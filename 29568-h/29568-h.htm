<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>It may interest, if it does not comfort,
the reader to know that this little story
is built upon facts. The ride of Harry,
the hundred-dollar pimple, the psychological
hair, the downfall of Roger, all happened,
while the Bishop&#8217;s Head is one of
the possessions of a New England family.</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH HARRY SWIFTLY PASSES FROM ONE STAGE OF HIS CAREER TO ANOTHER</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Harry and I were waiting for his
motor-car,&#8221; said the Honorable Socrates
Potter. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t stand and
wait&ndash;&ndash;that would be losing time&ndash;&ndash;so we
kept busy. Went into the stores and
bought things&ndash;&ndash;violets, candy, golf-balls,
tennis-shoes, new gloves, and neckties.
Harry didn&#8217;t need &#8217;em, but he couldn&#8217;t
waste any time and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s the car!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;In each store Harry had used the
magic words, &#8216;Charge it,&#8217; and passed on.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We were going over to Chesterville
to settle with the contractor who had built
his father&#8217;s house. We had an hour and
four minutes in which to do it all, and then&ndash;&ndash;the
6.03 express for New York. Harry had
to get it to be in time for a bridge party.</p>
<p>&#8220;We climbed in. Harry grabbed the
wheel. The gas-lever purred, the gears
clicked, the car jumped into motion and
rushed, screeching, up the hill ahead of us,
shot between a trolley-car and a wagon,
swung around a noisy runabout, scared a
team into the siding, and sped away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The town behind us! Country-houses
on either side! A bulldog in the near
perspective! He set himself, made a rush
at us, as if trying to grab a wheel off the
car, and the wheel got him. We flushed a
lot of chickens. The air seemed to be full
of them. Harry waved an apology to the
farmer, as if to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never mind, sir, I&#8217;m in a hurry now.
Take my number and charge it.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He struck a fowl, and, turning, I saw
a whirl of feathers in the air behind us and
the farmer&#8217;s fist waving above the dust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry would have paid for the dog
and the fowl in money but not in time&ndash;&ndash;not
even in a second of time! Harry had
an engagement for a bridge party and must
catch the 6.03 express.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man on a bicycle followed by a big
greyhound was just ahead. We screeched.
The man went into the ditch and took a
header. The greyhound didn&#8217;t have time
to turn out then. He bent to the oars
until he had gained lead enough to save
himself with a sidelong jump into the
buttercups.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Charge it!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The needle on the speedometer wavered
from fifty to fifty-five, then struck at sixty,
held a second there, and passed it. Gnats
and flies hit my face and stung like flying
shot. The top of the road went up in
a swirl of dust behind us. I hung on, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
my life in my trembling hands. We zipped
past teams and motor-cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;We filled every eye with dust and every
ear with screeches and every heart with a
swift pang of terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Charge it!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;A rider with a frightened horse raced
on ahead of us to the next corner. We sped
across the track into Chesterville and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hold up! There&#8217;s the office ahead.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The levers move, down goes the brake,
and we&#8217;re there.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Eleven miles in fourteen minutes!&#8217;
Harry exclaims, as I spring out and hurry
to the door. It was really sixteen minutes,
but I always allow Harry a slight discount.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not in!&#8217; I shout, in a second.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not in&ndash;&ndash;heart of Allah!&ndash;&ndash;where is he?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;At the Wilton job on the point.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;ll go get him.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You go; I&#8217;ll wait here.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Away he rushes&ndash;&ndash;I thank God for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
brief respite. This high power encourages
great familiarity with the higher powers.
But the Creator&#8217;s name is used here in no
light or profane spirit, let me say. In each
case it is only a brief prayer or, rather, the
beginning of a prayer which one has not
time to finish. It is cut short by a new
adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say to myself that I shall not ride
back with Harry. No, life is still dear to
me. I will take the trolley. And yet&ndash;&ndash;what
thrilling, Jove-like, superhuman deviltry
it was! I light a cigar and sit down.
Harry and Wilton arrive. Fifteen minutes
gone!</p>
<p>&#8220;I get down to business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry says: &#8216;Please cut it short.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have saved five hundred dollars
if I had had time to present our side of the
case with proper deliberation. But Harry
keeps shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do cut it short. I <i>must</i> get there&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
you know?&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Wilton must have his pay, too&ndash;&ndash;he
needs every cent of it to-morrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You go on. I&#8217;ll stay here and settle
this matter and go home by the trolley.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let&#8217;s stick together,&#8217; my young friend
entreats. &#8216;Please hurry it through and come
on with me. I need you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry must have company. His time
is wasted unless he has a spectator&ndash;&ndash;an
audience&ndash;&ndash;a witness&ndash;&ndash;a historian. Without
that, all his hair-breadth escapes would
be thrown away. His stories would hang
by a thread.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;ve only twenty-one minutes,&#8217; he calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say to myself: &#8216;Damn the man whose
money is like water and whose time is
more precious than the last hour of Mahomet.&#8217;
Well, of course, there was plenty
of money, but the supply of time was
limited. To waste a second was to lose
an opportunity for self-indulgence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I draw a check and take a hurried
receipt and jump in.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Away we go. &#8216;Look out!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The brakes grind, and we rise in the air
a little as a small boy crosses our bows.
We just missed him&ndash;&ndash;thank God!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t be reckless, old man&ndash;&ndash;go a bit
slower.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ve a clear road now.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a wind in our faces! There&#8217;s
the track ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Look out! The train! God Almighty!</i>&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke too late. We were almost up
to the rails when I saw it. We couldn&#8217;t
stop. Cleared the track in time. Felt
the wind of the engine in my back hair,
and then my scalp moved. Just ahead was
a light buggy in the middle of the road
and a bull, frightened by the cars, galloping
beside it.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the excitement Harry hadn&#8217;t time to
blow, and the roar of the train had covered
our noise. The bull turned into the ditch
and speeded up. We swerved between bull
and buggy and grazed the side of the latter.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I jumped and landed on the bull, and that
saved me. It&#8217;s the first time that I ever
knocked a bull down. He got to his feet
swiftly beside me, bellowed, and took the
fence. He was a fat, well-fed bull with a
big, round, soft side on him. I never knew
that a bull was so mellow. My feet sank
deep, and he gave way, and I hit him again
with another part of my person. I didn&#8217;t
mean it, and felt for him, although it is
likely that his feelings needed no further
help from me. Of course I bounded off
him at last and the earth hit me a hard
upper-cut, but the bull had been a highly
successful shock absorber. In a second
or so I was able to get up and look around.
The buggy had gone over, and the horse
was on his hind legs trying to climb out of
the dust-cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry stopped his car and began to
back up.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;ll do for me,&#8217; I said. &#8216;I don&#8217;t
sit in your padded cell any longer.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I had lived a whole three-volume novel
in the last forty minutes. The Panama
Canal had been finished and England had
become a republic. It was too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found two men&ndash;&ndash;one at the head of
the frightened horse, the other lying beside
the wrecked buggy with a broken leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Harry had an engagement to play
bridge!</p>
<p>&#8220;I took the horse&#8217;s head. The well man
pulled a stake off the fence and chased
Harry around the motor-car. He didn&#8217;t
intend to &#8216;charge it.&#8217; Wanted cash down.
I got hold of his arm and succeeded in
calming him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry apologized and assured them
that he was willing to pay the damage.
We picked up the injured man and took
him to his home. On the way Harry explained
that they should keep track of all
expenses and:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Charge it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a few minutes Harry roared off in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
the direction of Pointview to get a doctor
and the 6.03 express.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It might be a little late,&#8217; he said, as
he left us.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next day Harry was arrested as a
public enemy for criminal carelessness. He
had injured three men on the highways
of Connecticut, to say nothing of dogs
and poultry. Almost everybody had something
charged against Harry. He was highly
unpopular, but a good fellow at heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got the judge to release him on his
promise to abandon motoring for three years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus he rushed out of the motor-car stage
of his career into that of the drag and tandem.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had had more narrow escapes and
suffered greater perils than Rob Roy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, bulls are a good thing&ndash;&ndash;a comparatively
soft thing. I recommend them
to every motorist who may have to look
for a place to land. Don&#8217;t ever throw yourself
on the real estate of New England. It
can hit harder than you can.&#8221;</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>WHICH BEGINS THE STORY OF THE BISHOP&#8217;S HEAD</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Harry is the most modern character
in my little museum,&#8221; said the Honorable
Socrates Potter, as I sat with him in
his cozy office. &#8220;I was really introduced
to Harry by the Bishop of St. Clare, who
died in 1712. I didn&#8217;t know his heart
until the Bishop made us acquainted.
Strange! Well, that depends on the point
of view. You see, the Bishop was acquired
and imported as an ancestor by one of the
best families, and that&#8217;s how I happened
to meet him. They would have got William
the Conqueror&ndash;&ndash;of England and Fifth
Avenue&ndash;&ndash;if he hadn&#8217;t been well hidden.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am inclined to converse long and
loudly on the reconstruction of Pointview.
Of course I shall talk too much, but I am
a licensed liar, and the number of my
machine is 4227643720, so if I smash a
dog here and there, make a note of the number
and charge it. I&#8217;m going fast and shall
not have time to stop for apologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Pointview even Time has quickened
his pace. Last year is ancient history.
Lizzie has been succeeded by Miss Elizabeth,
who needs a maid, a chauffeur, a
footman, and a house-party to maintain
her spirits. Harry and his drag have
taken the place of Dan and his runabout.</p>
<p>&#8220;The enemy has arrived in force. We are
surrounded by country-houses and city
abdomens of appalling size and arrogance.
Mansions crown the slopes and line the
water-front. The dialect of the lazy Yankee
and his industrious hens are heard
no more in the hills of Pointview. Where
the hoe and the sickle were stirred by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
fear of hunger, the golf-club and the tennis-racket
are moved by the fear of fat. The
sweat of toil is now the perspiration of
exercise. The chatter of society has succeeded
that of the goose and the polliwog.
Land has gone up. Rocks have become
real estate even while they belonged to
Christian Scientists. Ledges, smitten by the
modern Moses, have gushed a stream of
gold. Once the land supported its owner.
Now wealth supports land and landlord
and the fullness thereof. The Fifth Avenue
farmer has begun to raise his own vegetables
at a dollar apiece and a crop of
criminals second to none. In his hands
farming becomes agriculture and the farm
a swarming nest of parasites.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in the midst of a new migration
from the cities back to the land, and all are
happy save the philosophers. It is a remote
reaction of former migrations to the
mines and the oil-fields. The descendants
of these very pioneers now seek to exchange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
a part of their gold for the ancient sod in
which are the roots of their family trees and
delusions.</p>
<p>&#8220;With these rich men came Henry
Delance, who grew up with me here and
went to Pittsburg in his early twenties and
made a fortune in the coal and iron business.
His grandfather was old Nick Delance, a
blacksmith; and his father owned a farm
on the hills and made a bare living for himself
and a large family. They had been
simple, hard-working, honest people. I
helped Henry to buy the old place, and, as
we stood together on the hilltop, he said
to me:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I often think of the old days that were
full of hard labor. What a woman my
mother was! Did all the work of the house
and raised seven boys and two girls, and
every one of them has had some success
in the world&ndash;&ndash;except me. One built a big
railroad, one was governor of a State, one
a member of Congress, one a noted physician,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
two have made millions, and both
of the girls married well. Now, my boy
has had every advantage&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But poverty,&#8217; I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But poverty,&#8217; he repeated, &#8216;and I&#8217;m
unable to give him that. It&#8217;s probably the
one thing that would make a man of him,
and I wouldn&#8217;t wonder if he succeeded in
achieving it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A rather large undertaking,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, but he&#8217;s well qualified,&#8217; Henry
answered, with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with your boy?&#8217;
I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;So busy with tomfoolery&ndash;&ndash;no time for
anything else. I&#8217;ve had so much to do
that I&#8217;ve rather neglected Harry, and now
he&#8217;s too much for me. He knows that he&#8217;s
got me beat on education, but that&#8217;s only
the beginning of what he knows. Good
fellow, you understand, but he&#8217;s young and
thinks me old-fashioned. I wish you&#8217;d
help me to make a man of him.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What can I do?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Get him interested in some kind of
work. He doesn&#8217;t like my business. He
hates Wall Street, and, knowing it as I do,
how can I blame the boy? He doesn&#8217;t
take to the law&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And, knowing it as I do, how can <i>I</i>
blame him?&#8217; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But, somehow, he hasn&#8217;t the spring in
his bow that I had&ndash;&ndash;the get-up-and-get&ndash;&ndash;the
disposition to move all hell if necessary.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You can&#8217;t expect it,&#8217; I said. &#8216;His
mainspring is broken.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What would you call his mainspring?&#8217;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The desire to win money and its power.
Mind you, I wouldn&#8217;t call that a high
motive, but in a young man it&#8217;s a kind of a
mainspring that sets him a-going and keeps
the works busy until he can get better motive
power. In Harry it&#8217;s broken.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re right&ndash;&ndash;it was busted long ago,&#8217;
said Henry Delance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Some one has got to contrive a new
mainspring for the sons of millionaires&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re
so plenty these days.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s the desire to be respectable,&#8217;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But it is not nearly so universal as
the love of money. If it were possible to
have millionaire carpenters and shoemakers
there&#8217;d be more hope! But I&#8217;ll try to
invent a mainspring for Harry. If he doesn&#8217;t
marry some fool woman there&#8217;s a chance
for the boy&ndash;&ndash;a good chance. Tell me all
about him.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;In his own way, which amused me a
little, the old man sketched the character
of his son, or rather confessed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A kind of Alexander the Great,&#8217; he
said. &#8216;We shall have to be careful or lose
our heads. Surfeited with power, you know.
When he wants anything he goes to a store
and says, &#8220;Charge it.&#8221; That has ruined him.
He&#8217;s no scale of values in his mind.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me, then, with some evidence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
of alarm, that Harry had become interested
in a fool woman, older than he, noted for
her beauty and equestrian skill&ndash;&ndash;by name
Mrs. Revere-Chalmers, of a well-known
Southern family. I knew the woman&ndash;&ndash;divorced
from a rich old gentleman of great
generosity, who had taken all the blame
for her sake. But I happened to know
that the circumstances on her side were
not creditable. The truth, however, had
been well concealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;In her youth Frances Revere had two
beautiful parents. In fact, they were all
that any girl could desire&ndash;&ndash;obedient and
respectful to their youngers. She was always
kind to them and kept them looking
neatly and helped them in their lessons
and brought them up in the fear of Tiffany
and the hope of future happiness. They
played most of the time, but never chased
each other in and out of the bedrooms or
made any noise about the house when she
lay sleeping in the forenoon. Their sense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
of chivalry would not have permitted it.
When she arose she called them to her and
patted their heads and said: &#8216;What dear
parents I have!&#8217; It might be thought that
the fair Frances led an aimless and idle
life. Not so. The young lady was very
busy and never forgot her aim. She was
preparing herself to be a marryer of men
and the leading marryer in the proud city
of her birth. Every member of the household
became her assistant in this noble
industry. Many storekeepers had unconsciously
joined her staff and &#8216;charged it&#8217;
until they were weary. All her papa&#8217;s
money had been invested in the business,
and he began to borrow for a rainy day.
Then there came a long spell of wet weather.
At last something had to be done. Frances
began to use her talents. No prince or
noble duke had come for her, so she married
an old man worth ten million dollars and
sent her parents to an orphan asylum with
a fair allowance of spending-money. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
are her only heirs, and now, at thirty, but
with ample capital, she has set up again
in the marrying business.</p>
<p>&#8220;She lives in a big country-house, and has
a lot of cats and dogs that are shampooed
every day. Her life is pretty much devoted
to the regulation of hair. Her own
requires the exclusive attention of a hired
girl. Its tint, luster, and general effect
show excellent taste and close application.
Considering its area, her scalp is
the most remarkable field of industry in
Connecticut. Has herself made into a kind
of life-sized portrait every day and carefully
framed and lighted and hung. It
is a beautiful portrait, but it is not a
portrait of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her life is arduous. I have some
reason to think that it wearies her. She
rings for the masseuse at 10.30 <span class='smcap'>A.M.</span> and
breakfasts in bed at twelve o&#8217;clock. Soon
after that the chiropodist and the manicure
and the hair-dresser begin to saw wood;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
then the grooms and second footmen. At
two o&#8217;clock she goes out to pat the head of
the ten-thousand-dollar bull and give some
sugar to the horses, all of whom have been
prepared for this ordeal by bathing and
massage.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to be able to pat the head of a
ten-thousand-dollar bull. It&#8217;s a pretty vanity.
All the Fifth Avenue farmers indulge
in it. Some slap them on the back and some
poke them in the ribs with the point of a
parasol, but the correct thing is to pat
them on the head and say: Dear old Romeo!</p>
<p>&#8220;After a turn in the saddle Mrs. Revere-Chalmers
led society until midnight. With
her a new spirit had arrived in the ancient
stronghold of the Yankee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began to learn things about Harry&ndash;&ndash;a
big, blond, handsome youth who had traveled
much. He had been to school in New
York, London, Florence, and Paris, and had
graduated from Harvard. For a time he
called it Hahvud, but passed that trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
without serious injury and put it behind him.
In the European stage of his career he had
been attacked by lions, griffins, and battle-axes
and had lost some of his red blood.
There he had acquired a full line of Fifth
Avenue dialect and conversation with trills
and grace notes from France and Italy.
He had been slowly recovering from that
trouble for a year or so when I met him.
Now and then a good, strong, native idiom
burst out in his conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry was a man without a country,
having never had a fair chance to acquire
one. He had touched many high and low
places&ndash;&ndash;from the top of the Eiffel Tower
to the lowest depths of the underworld.
Also, he knew the best hotels in Europe and
eastern America, and the Duke of Sutherland
and the Lord Mayor of London, and
Jack Johnson, the pugilist. Harry knew
only the upper and lower ends of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was an extremist. Also, he was a
prolific and generous liar. He lied not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
deceive, but to entertain. There was a
kind of noble charity in his lying. He
would gladly perjure his soul to speed an
hour for any good friend. His was the
fictional imagination largely exercised in the
cause of human happiness. Now and then
he became the hero of his own lies, but he
was generally willing to divide the honors.
His friends knew not when to believe him,
and he often deceived them when he was
telling the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early in April, Henry Delance came to
me and said: &#8216;Soc, you&#8217;ve been working
hard for years, and you need a rest. Let&#8217;s
get aboard the next steamer and spend a
fortnight in England.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had little taste for foreign travel, but
Betsey urged me to go, and I went with
Henry and his wife, their daughter Ruth
and the boy Harry, and sundry maids and
valets. We had been a week in London,
when Henry and the Mrs. came into
my room one day, aglow with excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
Mrs. Delance was first to address
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Potter, congratulate us,&#8217; said she.
&#8216;We find that Henry is a lineal descendant
of William the Conqueror.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Henry, it is possible that William
could prove an alibi, or maybe you could,&#8217;
I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;d make an effort,&#8217; said he, with a
trace of embarrassment, &#8216;but my wife
thinks that we had better plead guilty
and let it go. That kind of thing
doesn&#8217;t interest me so much as it does her.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;After all,&#8217; I answered, by way of consolation,
&#8216;if you think it&#8217;s like to do you
any harm, it doesn&#8217;t need to get out. I shall
respect your confidence.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Too late!&#8217; his wife exclaimed. &#8216;The
facts have been cabled to America.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was writing letters in my room, next
day, when Harry interrupted me with a
hurried entrance. He locked the door
inside, and in a kind of playful silence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
drew from under his rain-coat, and deposited
on my table, a human skull.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Bishop of St. Clare,&#8217; he whispered,
in that curious dialect which I shall not
try to imitate.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He isn&#8217;t looking very well,&#8217; I said, not
knowing what he meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This is the Bishop&#8217;s head&ndash;&ndash;the Bishop
of St. Clare,&#8217; Harry whispered again. &#8216;He
was one of our ancestors&ndash;&ndash;by Jove!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is that all that was the matter with
him?&#8217; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No; his epitaph says that he died of a
fever in 1712.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How did you get hold of his head?&#8217;
I asked. &#8216;Win it in a raffle?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I bribed the old verger in the crypt
of St. Mary&#8217;s. Offered him two sovereigns
to lift the stone lid and let me look in. He
said he couldn&#8217;t do that, but discreetly
withdrew when I put the money in his hand.
It was up to me, don&#8217;t you know, and here
is the Bishop&#8217;s head.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Going to have him photographed in a
group of the family?&#8217; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, but you see Materna paid two
pounds for a chunk off a tombstone, and I
thought I would give her a souvenir worth
having,&#8217; said he, and blushed for the first
time since our interview had begun. &#8216;This
is unique.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And you didn&#8217;t think the Bishop
would miss it?&#8217; I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not seriously,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;I guess
it&#8217;s a fool thing to have done, but I thought
that I could have some fun with the Bishop&#8217;s
head. Mother is going to round up
all the Delances at Christmas for a big
dinner&ndash;&ndash;uncles, aunts, and cousins, you
know&ndash;&ndash;a celebration of our genealogical
discoveries with a great family tree in the
center of the table. The history of the
Delances will be read, and I thought that
I would spring a surprise&ndash;&ndash;tell them that I
had invited our old ancestor, Sir Robert
Delance, Bishop of St. Clare; that, contrary
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
to my hope, he had accepted, and that
I would presently introduce him. In due
time I would produce the head and read
from his life and writings, which I bought
in a London book-stall. Finally, I thought
that I would have him tell how he happened
to be present. Don&#8217;t you think he would
make a hit?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He would surely make a hit&ndash;&ndash;a resounding
hit,&#8217; I said, &#8216;but not as a proof of
respectability. Even if the Bishop is your
ancestor, you have no good title to his bones.
I presume that every visitor to the old church
puts his name and address in a register?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, suppose the theft is discovered and
the verger gives you away. All the money
you&#8217;ve got wouldn&#8217;t keep you out of prison.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry began to turn pale. He was a
good fellow, but this genealogical frenzy
had turned his head, and his head was
not as old as the Bishop&#8217;s. It was unduly
young.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Assume that you get home with your
prize, the Bishop&#8217;s head would be the worst
enemy that his descendants ever had. It
would always accuse you and grin at your
follies. And would you dare proclaim the
truth over in Pointview that you really
have the skull of the Bishop of St. Clare?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy was scared. He had suddenly
discovered an important fact. It was the
north pole of his education.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;By Jove! I&#8217;m an ass,&#8217; he said. &#8216;What
shall I do with it?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Say nothing of the thing to anybody,
not even to your father, and get rid of it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do,&#8217; he said, as he
wrapped the skull in a piece of newspaper,
hid it under his coat, and left me.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sailed next afternoon, and that
evening, when Harry and I sat alone in a
corner of the deck, I asked him what
he had done with the Bishop&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tried to get rid of it, but couldn&#8217;t,&#8217;
he said. &#8216;My conscience smote me, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
took the old bone back to St. Mary&#8217;s.
Going to do my duty like a man, you see,
but it wouldn&#8217;t work. New verger on the
job! I weakened. Then I put it in a box
and had it addressed to a fictitious man in
Bristol, and sent my valet to get it off by
express. It went on, and was returned for a
better address. You see, my valet&ndash;&ndash;officious
ass!&ndash;&ndash;had left his address at the express
office. How <i>gauche</i> of him! While we
were lying at the dock a messenger came to
my state-room with the Bishop&#8217;s head. I
had to take it and pay five shillings and a
sixpence for the privilege.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The old Bishop seems to be quite attached
to his new relative,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, but when the deck is deserted, by
and by, I&#8217;m going to drop him overboard.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is what he did&ndash;&ndash;dropped it,
solemnly, from the ship&#8217;s side at dinnertime,
and I witnessed the proceeding.</p>
<p>&#8220;The adventure had one result that was
rather curious and unexpected. It brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
Harry close to me and established our relations
to each other. That they admitted
me to his confidence as a friend and counselor
of the utmost frankness was on the
whole exceedingly fortunate. From that
time he began to trust me and to distrust
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it happened that I was really introduced
to Harry by the Bishop of St. Clare,
who died in 1712, and those credentials
gave me a standing which I could not otherwise
have enjoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming home, I limbered up my imagination
and outlied Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was forced to invent that cheerful,
handy liar the late Dr. Godfrey Vogeldam
Guph, Professor of the Romance Languages
in the University of Brague and the intimate
friend of any great man you may be pleased
to mention. With his help I have laid
low even the most authoritative, learned,
and precise liars in the State of Connecticut.
I do it by quoting from his memoirs.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Harry&#8217;s specialty were lies of adventure
in court and palace, and, as Dr. Guph had
known all the crowned heads, he became
an ever-present help in time of trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every lie of Harry&#8217;s I outdid with
another of ampler proportions. He put
on a little more steam, but I kept abreast
or a length ahead of him. By and by he
broke down and begged for quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;On my word as a gentleman,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;that last story I told was true. It really
happened, don&#8217;t you know?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, Harry, if you will only notify me
when you propose to tell the truth, I shall be
glad to take your word for it,&#8217; was my answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And keep Dr. Guph chained,&#8217; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Exactly, and give you like warning
when I have a lie ready to launch.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s a fair treaty,&#8217; he agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And a good idea,&#8217; I said. &#8216;As a liar
of long experience I have found it best to
notify all comers what to expect of me when
I see a useful lie in the offing. That has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
enabled me to give my fancy full play
without impairing my reputation. My
noblest faculties have had ample exercise
while my word has remained at par.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;We made an agreement along that line,
and Harry ceased to be a liar, and became a
story-teller of much humor and ingenuity.&#8221;</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>WHICH IS THE STORY OF THE PIMPLED QUEEN AND THE BLACK SPOT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, on our return, Mrs. Delance had
a helmet and a battle-ax, with sundry
accessories, emblazoned on her letter-heads
and the doors of her limousine. Here was
another case of charge it, but this time it
was charged against her slender capital
of good sense. Mrs. Delance was a stout
lady of the Dreadnought type. Harry settled
down in the home of his father and
began to study the &#8216;middle clahsses&#8217; with
a drag and tandem and garments for every
kind of leisure. The girls went to ride with
him, and naturally began to smarten their
dress and accents and to change their estimates.
His &#8216;aristocratic&#8217; friends and manners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
were much in their company and ever
in their dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, all that began to react on the
young men: if that was the kind of thing
the girls liked, they must try to be in it.
Slowly but surely a Pointview aristocracy
began its line of cleavage and a process of
integration. Crests appeared on the letter-heads
and limousine doors of the newly
rich. In a month or so people of brain
and substance degenerated into a condition
of hardened shameless idiocy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of our best citizens went abroad,
each to find his place among the descendants
of William the Conqueror. Suddenly I
discovered that the clerk in my office was
ashamed to be seen on the street with a
package in his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our young men began to long for wealth
and leisure. They grew impatient of the
old process of thrift and industry. It was
too slow. Many of them opened accounts
in Wall Street.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Young Roger Daniels had some luck
there and began to advertise the fact with a
small steam-yacht and a cruise. We were
going as hard as ever to keep up, but on
higher levels of aspiration. The girls were
engaged in a strenuous contest for the prize
of Harry&#8217;s favor, with that handsome young
<i>divorc&eacute;e</i> well in the lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger and his party were about to return
from their cruise, and Harry was to
give them a ball at the Yacht Club.</p>
<p>&#8220;The day before the ball our best known
physician came to see Mrs. Potter, who was
ill, and cheered us up with a story. The
Doctor was young, attractive, and able.
He had threatened every appendix in Pointview,
and had a lot of inside information
about our men and women&ndash;&ndash;especially the
latter. He looked weary.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yesterday was a little hard on me,&#8217;
he said. &#8216;It began at four in the morning
with a confinement case and ended at one
<span class='smcap'>A.M.</span> There were two operations at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
hospital, a steady stream at the office, and a
twenty-mile ride over the hills. Got back
in the evening pretty well worn out.
Tumbled into bed at two minutes of eleven,
and was asleep before the clock struck.
The &#8217;phone-bell at my bedside awoke me.
I let it go on for a minute. Hadn&#8217;t energy
enough to get up. It rang and rang.
Out I tumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hello!&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A voice answered. &#8220;I am Mrs. So-and-So&#8217;s
butler,&#8221; it said. &#8220;She wishes to see
you as soon as you can get here. It&#8217;s very
urgent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, sir, but it is serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;All right,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My chauffeur was off for the night, so
I &#8217;phoned to the stable and got Patrick
and told him to hitch up the black mare
at once, dressed, and took everything that
I was likely to need in an emergency, got
into the wagon, and hurried away in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
darkness. After all, I thought, it is something
to have one&#8217;s skill so much in request
by the rich and the powerful. It was a
long ride with one horse-power, but we got
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Many windows of the great house were
aglow. The first butler met me in the hall
and took me to my lady&#8217;s chamber&ndash;&ndash;an
immense room finished in the style of the
First Empire. She was half reclining and
playing solitaire as she smoked a cigarette
on a divan that occupied a dais overhung
with rare tapestries on a side of the room.
The effect of the whole thing was queenly&ndash;&ndash;<i>&agrave;
la</i> R&eacute;camier. She greeted me wearily
and without rising.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said she, and I did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She turned to a good-looking maid
who timidly stood near the divan.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;My dear little woman, you weary me&ndash;&ndash;please
go,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The maid went.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Dawctah,&#8221; the lady said to me, &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
have a nahsty little pimple on my right
cheek, and I really cahn&#8217;t go to the ball,
you know, unless it is cuahed. Won&#8217;t you
kindly&ndash;&ndash;ah&ndash;&ndash;see what can be done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;A pimple! God prosper it!&#8221; I said to
myself. &#8220;Has the great M.D. become a
P.D.&ndash;&ndash;a mere doctor of pimples?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I inspected the pimple&ndash;&ndash;a very slight
affair.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Why, if I were you, I&#8217;d just cover the
pimple with a little square of court-plaster,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;It would become you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;What a pretty idea! That&#8217;s just
what I will do,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Please charge it, Dawctah,&#8221; she said,
wearily, as she resumed her solitaire.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I charged a hundred dollars, but
nothing could pay me for the humiliation
I suffered. Going home, I pounded the mare
shamefully.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You charged a good price,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes; but it&#8217;s like pulling teeth to get
any money out of her. One has to earn it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
twice. Worth a million, and hangs everybody
up. Some have to sue.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Does nothing to-day that can be done
to-morrow,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;True,&#8217; said he; &#8216;she don&#8217;t look after
her business, and thinks that every one is
trying to cheat her.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Same old story,&#8217; was my remark. I
was her husband&#8217;s lawyer. &#8216;Well, dear,
how much do you suppose McCrory&#8217;s bill
is for the last month?&#8217; he would ask her.
She would look thoughtful and say: &#8216;Oh,
about fifteen hundred dollars.&#8217; &#8216;My dear,&#8217;
he would go on, &#8216;it is ten thousand six
hundred and forty-three dollars and twenty-four
cents.&#8217; &#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s impossible,&#8217; she
would answer. &#8216;There&#8217;s some mistake
about it. I&#8217;ll never O.K. such a bill.
It&#8217;s an outrage!&#8217; But the bill was always
right.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I didn&#8217;t suppose you would know the
lady&ndash;&ndash;I haven&#8217;t mentioned her name,&#8217;
said the Doctor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know her, but don&#8217;t worry&ndash;&ndash;I shall
not betray your confidence. I knew her
husband. It wore him out looking after
the charge-it department. Now she&#8217;s trying
to get Harry Delance for his job.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She&#8217;s badly in need of a clerk,&#8217; said the
Doctor, &#8216;and I hope she gets one. He could
look after the pimples as well as I can.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many were getting ready for the ball,
but this lady was the only one I knew of
who had spent a hundred dollars for facial
improvement. Harry, however, was about
to spend a thousand dollars for the improvement
of his conscience. It was one
of the necessary expenses and it came about
in this way:</p>
<p>&#8220;The day of the ball had arrived. Harry
came to see me about noon. He said that
he had been busy all the morning with
preparations for the ball, but&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;He showed me a telegram. It was from
Roger Daniels, and it said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The recent slump in the market has put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
me in hell&#8217;s hole. Please wire one thousand
dollars to Bridgeport, where I am hung up.
If you do, I shall give you good collateral
and eternal gratitude. If you don&#8217;t, we
shall have to miss the ball. Please remember
that I am waiting at the other end of
the wire like a hungry cat at a mouse-hole.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry looked worried. The ball must
come off, and, without Roger, it would be
like Hamlet minus the melancholy Dane.
It was a special compliment to Roger.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What do you advise me to do?&#8217; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pay it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It will probably be a dead loss.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Probably, but it&#8217;s plainly up to you.
He&#8217;s got in trouble keeping your pace. To
tell the honest truth, you&#8217;re responsible for
it, and the public will charge it to your
account. You must pay the bill or suffer
moral bankruptcy.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry was taken by surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I can pay for <i>my</i> folly,&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes; but when it becomes another man&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
folly it&#8217;s stolen property, and as much
yours as ever. The goods have your
mark on &#8217;em, and, by and by, they&#8217;re dumped
at your door. They may be damaged by
dirt and vermin, but you&#8217;ve got to take &#8217;em.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;After all, Harry, why should a young
man whose education has cost a hundred
thousand dollars, if a cent, be giving up his
life to folly? You&#8217;re too smart to spend the
most of your time looking beautiful&ndash;&ndash;trying
to excite the admiration of women and
the envy of men. That might do in some
of the old countries where the people are as
dumb as cattle and are capable only of the
emotion of awe and need professional
gentlemen to excite it, and to feed upon their
substance. Here the people have their
moments of weakness, but mostly they are
pretty level-headed. They judge men by
what they do, not by what they look like.
The professional gentleman is first an object
of curiosity and then an object of scorn.
He&#8217;s not for us. Young man, I knew your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
father and your grandfather. I like you
and want you to know that I am speaking
kindly, but you ought to go to work.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Potter, he said, &#8216;upon my word,
sir, I&#8217;m going to work one of these days&ndash;&ndash;at
something&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t know what.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The sooner the better,&#8217; I said. &#8216;Work
is the thing that makes men&ndash;&ndash;nothing else.
In Pointview everybody used to work.
Now here are some facts for your genealogy
that you haven&#8217;t discovered. Your grandfather
and grandmother raised a family
of nine children and never had a servant&ndash;&ndash;think
of that. Your grandmother made
clothes for the family and did all the work
of the house. She was a doctor, a nurse,
a teacher, a spinner, a weaver, a knitter, a
sewer, a cook, a washerwoman, a gentle
and tender mother. Now we are beginning
to rot with idleness.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me tell you a story of a modern
lady of Pointview.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I told him of the Doctor&#8217;s call
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
on the pimpled queen at midnight, and
added:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Think of that! Think of the fathomless
depths of vanity and selfishness that
lie under that pimple. It&#8217;s a monument
more sublime than the Matterhorn. Think
of the poor fellow that has to marry that
human millstone, and be the clerk of her
charge-it department.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can think of no worse luck, really,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;I wonder who it is!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Doctors never give names,&#8217; I said.
&#8216;But you might look for the little black
square of court-plaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;By Jove!&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;I shall look
with interest.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ball came off, and Roger got there,
and so did the lady and the square of black
court-plaster; and that night Harry began
a new stage in his career.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, Harry was no dunce, but he
was not yet convinced.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>&#8220;When people have little to do they go
back to childishness. They long for
novelty&ndash;&ndash;new playthings, new adventures,
new sensations, new friends. So our upper
classes are utterly restless. Every old
pleasure is a slough of despond. The
ladies have tried jewels, laces, crests, titled
husbands, divorces, gambling, cocktails,
cigarettes, and other branches of exhilaration.
They have passed through the slums
of literature and of the East Side of Gotham.
The gentlemen have shown them the way
and smiled with amusement and gone on
to greater triumphs. To these people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
every old idea is &#8216;bromide.&#8217; It bores them.
They scoff at men &#8216;who take themselves
seriously.&#8217; In a word, Moses and the
Prophets are so much &#8216;dope.&#8217; And they
are excellent people who really want to
make the world better, but the childish
craze for novelty is upon them. Mrs.
Revere-Chalmers was one of this kind.
Harry came to me next day at my house
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;By Jove! you know, it was my friend
Mrs. R.-C. who wore the black square.
But she is really a charming woman&ndash;&ndash;not at
all a bad sort. I want you to know her
better. She made me promise to bring
you over to-morrow afternoon if you would
come.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;We went. It was a &#8216;new-thought&#8217;
tea&ndash;&ndash;a deep, brain-racking, forefinger-on-the-brow
function. You could see the
thoughts of the ladies and sometimes hear
them as a &#8216;professor&#8217; with long hair and
smiles of fathomless inspiration wrapped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
himself in obscurity and called unto them
out of the depths. He was all depth. They
gazed at his soulful eyes and plunged into
deep thought, catching at straws, and he
returned to New York by the next train
and probably made another payment, on
account, to his landlady. Tea and conversation
followed his departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had observed that Mrs. Revere-Chalmers
had undergone a singular change
of aspect, but failed to locate the point of
difference until a sister had said to her in a
tone of honeyed deviltry:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My dear, you are growing younger&ndash;&ndash;quite
surely younger, and your hair is so
lovely and so&ndash;&ndash;different! You know what
I mean&ndash;&ndash;it has the luster of youth, and the
shade is adorable without a trace of gray
in it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;This last phrase was the point of the
dagger, and Mrs. Chalmers felt it. Sure
enough, her hair had changed its hue, and
was undeniably fuller and younger.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then our hostess gave out a confession
which has made some history and is fully
qualified to make more. It is a curious
fact that one who is abnormal enough to
commit a crime is apt to have poor caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have been taking lessons of the Professor,
and have produced this hair by concentration,&#8217;
said she. &#8216;It is a creation of the
new thought and so wonderful I could
almost forgive one for not believing me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A gem of thought&ndash;&ndash;a hair poem!&#8217;
I could not help exclaiming. &#8216;Did it come
all at once, in a flood of inspiration, or hair
by hair?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All at once,&#8217; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I charged it and went on as if nothing
great had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Considered as a work of the imagination,
it is wonderful, and should rank with
the best of Shakespeare&#8217;s,&#8217; I assured her.
&#8216;But it will subject you to unsuspected
perils, for your footstool will be the shrine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
of the hairless and you shall see the top of
every bald head in America.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another lady sprang to her assistance
by telling how she had extracted a pearl
necklace from an unwilling husband who
had said that he couldn&#8217;t afford it, by concentration.
The new thought had fetched him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The noble unselfishness with which they
had used this miraculous gift of the spirit
appealed to Harry and to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that brilliant company was a slim
woman of the armored cruiser type, who had
come to Betsey one day and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re spoiling your husband. You
make too much of him. You don&#8217;t seem
to know how to manage a husband, and the
husbands of Pointview are being ruined by
your example. They expect too much of
us. We women have got to stand together.
Don&#8217;t you read the <i>Female Gazette</i>?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No&ndash;&ndash;I have been waiting till I could
get a rubber-plant and other accessories,&#8217;
said Betsey.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, it may not be <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>, but it
is full of good sense,&#8217; said the lady. &#8216;I&#8217;ve
brought an article with me that I wish you
would read.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She left the article, and its title was
&#8216;How to Manage a Husband.&#8217; It averred
that too much petting, too much indulgence,
made a man selfish and conceited;
that affection should be administered with
scientific reserve. Men should be taught
to wait on themselves, and all that.</p>
<p>&#8220;They called on me for remarks, and I
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am glad to have become acquainted
with the power of concentration. I propose
that we all quit work and begin to
concentrate. Matter is only a creation
of spirit. Let us exercise our several
sovereign spirits and try to turn out a
better line of matter. Let us have fewer
rocks and stones and more comforts.
Sweat and toil are a great mistake. Let us
turn Delance&#8217;s Hill into plum-pudding and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
the stones thereof into caramels and its pond
into tomato-soup. Why not? They have
no reality, no substance. They are nothing
but thoughts&ndash;&ndash;and our thoughts, at that&ndash;&ndash;and
why shouldn&#8217;t we change &#8217;em? But
somehow we can&#8217;t fetch it. According
to the Professor, we have got into the
habit of thinking in terms of rock, soil, and
water, and we can&#8217;t get over it. There are
some few of us who stand for better things;
but the majority keep thinking in the old
rut, and we can&#8217;t sway them. The Professor
says that all we need is to get together
and agree and then concentrate.
But agreement doesn&#8217;t seem to be necessary.
You know that there was a time when
everybody, after much concentration, agreed
that the world was flat&ndash;&ndash;everybody but one
man. Now the world was stubborn. It
wouldn&#8217;t give up. It hung on to its roundness,
and let the people think what they
pleased. They tried to flatten it with
countless tons of concentration, but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
held its shape. The one man had his way
about it. So don&#8217;t be discouraged by an
adverse majority on this plum-pudding
project. One lady has shown us a sample
of concentrated hair, and it looks good to
me. Why all this striving, all this trouble
about the problems of life and death, when
the straight, broad way of concentration
is open to us? Why shouldn&#8217;t we have
concentrated bread and meat and shoes and
socks and silks.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now the subject of concentration is
by no means new. It has been a success
for centuries. The late Dr. Guph tells in
his memoirs of a singular race of people
known as the Flub Dubs who once dwelt
on the lost isle of Atlantis. They were the
greatest concentrators that ever lived.
Every one thought that he was the greatest
man in the world, and thought it so hard
and so persistently that it came true&ndash;&ndash;in a
way. Naturally they aimed high, and every
man thought himself the rightful king, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
a strife arose over the crown, so that no one
could wear it and many were slain in a great
tussle. And when they were resting from
their struggles one rose and said: &#8220;Kings
of the realm, you are as the dust under my
feet. I scorn you. A few minutes ago
I decided to reverse my concentrator and
aim at a higher goal. It was easy of attainment.
I have suddenly become the
biggest fool on this island and the humblest
of all men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The announcement was greeted with
great applause, and within three minutes
his popularity had so enhanced that they
put him on the throne. Such was the power
of truth. And all confessed and joined his
party, and he was known as the wisest
king of the Flub Dubs.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The moral that Dr. Guph adduces is this:
You cannot make figs out of thistles, and
unregulated concentration leads to trouble.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry and I started for home in a deep
silence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hell!&#8217; I exclaimed, presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And that reminds me that I feel like
the king of the Flub Dubs,&#8217; said Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Which indicates that you are likely
to decline the office,&#8217; I remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s serious business&ndash;&ndash;this matter of
finding a wife,&#8217; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with Marie Benson?&#8217;
I asked. &#8216;There&#8217;s a real woman and the
best-looking girl in Connecticut.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Charming girl!&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;But,
dear boy! she talks too much.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That is a fault that could be remedied;
and, after all, it&#8217;s a kind of generosity. It&#8217;s
the very opposite of concentration.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah&ndash;&ndash;if she would only reform!&#8217; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Leave that to me,&#8217; I answered, as he
dropped me at my door.&#8221;</p>

<h3>IN WHICH SOCRATES DISCUSSES THE OVER-PRODUCTION OF TALK</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Marie was my ward, and as pretty a
girl as ever led a bulldog or ate a
box of chocolates at a sitting. She was a
charming fish-hook, baited with beauty and
wealth and culture and remarkable innocence.
She had dangled about on mama&#8217;s
rod and line for a year or so, but the fish
wouldn&#8217;t bite. For that reason I grabbed
the rod from the old lady and put on a bait
of silence and a sinker, and moved to deep
water and began to do business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie had a failing, for which, I am
sorry to say, she was in no way distinguished.
She talked too much, as Harry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
had said. There are too many American
women who talk too much. Marie&#8217;s mother
used to talk about six-thirds of the time.
You had to hear it, and then you had to
get over it. She had a way of spiking the
shoes of Time so that every hour felt like
a month while it was running over you.
You ought to have seen her climb the
family tree or the sturdy old chestnut of her
own experience and shake down the fruit!
Marie had one more tree in her orchard.
She had added the spreading peach of a
liberal education to the deadly upas of
Benson genealogy and the sturdy old chestnut
of mama&#8217;s experience. The <i>vox Bensonorum</i>
was as familiar as the Congregational
bell. The supply of it exceeded
the demand, and after every one was
loaded and ready to cast off, the barrels
came rolling down the chute.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next time I saw Marie she was a
bit cast down. She wished me to suggest
something for her to do. Said she wanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
a mission&ndash;&ndash;a chance to do some good in
the world. Thought she&#8217;d enjoy being a
nurse. I felt sorry for the girl, and suddenly
I saw the flicker of a brilliant
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Marie,&#8217; I said, &#8216;as a member of The
Society of Useful Women you are under
a serious obligation, and you have taste
for missionary work. Well, what&#8217;s the
matter with beginning on Nancy Doolittle?
You owe her a duty and ought
to have the courage&ndash;&ndash;nay, the kindness&ndash;&ndash;to
perform it. Nancy talks too much.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, I should say so,&#8217; said Marie.
&#8216;Nancy is a scourge&ndash;&ndash;I have often thought
of it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She&#8217;s downright wasteful,&#8217; I went on.
&#8216;She fills every hour with information, and
then throws on some more. It keeps
coming. Your seams open, and then it&#8217;s
every hand to the pumps! Dora Perkins
and Rebecca Ford are just as extravagant.
They toss out gems of thought and chunks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
of knowledge as if they were as common as
caramels.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You should go to these girls and kindly
but firmly remind them of this fault.
Tell them that too much conversation
has created more old maids and grass
and parlor widows than any other cause.
Give them a little lecture on the old law
of supply and demand. Show them that
it applies to conversation as well as to
cabbages&ndash;&ndash;that if one&#8217;s talk is too plentiful,
it becomes very cheap. Suggest that
if Methuselah had lived until now and
witnessed all the adventures of the human
race, he couldn&#8217;t afford to waste
his knowledge. If he talked only half the
time nobody would believe him. They&#8217;d
think he was crazy, and they&#8217;d know why,
in past ages, everybody had died but him,
and they&#8217;d wonder how he had managed
to survive the invention of gunpowder.
These girls have overestimated the value
of good-will. Their securities are not well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
secured. There are millions of watered
stock in their treasuries, and it isn&#8217;t worth
five cents on the dollar. Marie, you can
have a lot of fun. I almost envy you.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tell these girls that the remedy is
simple. They must be careful to regulate
the supply to the demand. They could
easily raise the price above par by denying
now and then that they have any conversation
in the treasury.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie promised to undertake this important
work, and I knew that in connection
with it she would also get some valuable
advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, this tendency to extravagant
display has sunk in very deep. Our
young people really do know a lot, and
they want others to know that they know
it. They are plumed with culture, and it
has become a charge instead of a credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, things began to mend. Betsey
and I went to dine with the Bensons one
evening, and Marie was as quiet as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
lamb. She answered modestly when we
spoke to her. She told no stories; her
jeweled crown of culture was not in sight;
she listened with notable success, and
delighted us with well-managed and illuminating
silence. Neither she nor her
mother nor Mrs. Bryson ventured to interrupt
the talk of a noted professor who
dined with us. Marie was charming.</p>
<p>&#8220;After dinner she led me into the library,
where we sat down together.</p>
<p>&#8220;She seemed a little embarrassed, and
presently said, with a laugh, &#8216;I had a talk
with those girls, as you suggested.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What did they say?&#8217; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What didn&#8217;t they say?&#8217; she exclaimed.
&#8216;They flew at me like wildcats. They tore
me to pieces&ndash;&ndash;said I was the most dreaded
talker in Pointview, that I had talked a
steady stream ever since I was born, that
nobody had a chance to get in a word with
me, that I had made all the boys sick who ever
came to see me. What do you think of that?&#8217;</p>

&#8220;WHAT DIDN&#8217;T THEY SAY? THEY FLEW AT ME LIKE WILDCATS.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s a gross exaggeration!&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, I thought it over, and made
up my mind they were right,&#8217; she went
on. &#8216;We kissed and made up and organized
the Listeners&#8217; Circle, and mama
and Mrs. Bryson and Mrs. Doolittle have
joined. Our purpose is to regulate our
talk supply very strictly to the demand.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s a grand idea!&#8217; I exclaimed. &#8216;The
Ladies&#8217; Talk and Information Trust! Why,
it will soon control the entire product of
Pointview, and can fix the price. Marie,
it&#8217;s only a matter of time when the conversation
of you girls is going to be in the
nature of a luxury and as much desired as
diamonds. It won&#8217;t be long before some
young fellow will offer his life for one word
from you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, <i>I&#8217;m</i> hopeless! Nobody cares for
me&ndash;&ndash;not a soul!&#8217; said Marie.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wait and give &#8217;em a chance,&#8217; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you think it&#8217;s true that I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
been such a pestilence?&#8217; she asked, as
her fingers toyed with the upholstery.
&#8216;You know you&#8217;ve been a kind of father
to me, and I want you to tell me frankly
if I&#8217;ve really made the boys sick.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, my dear child, if I were a young
man I&#8217;d be kneeling at your feet,&#8217; I said;
and no wonder, for they were a beautiful
pair of feet, and none ever supported a
nobler girl. Then I went on: &#8216;Marie, your
talk is charming. The demand continues.
I feel honored by your confidence. Please
go on.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I believe I&#8217;ve been foolish without
knowing it,&#8217; she said, her smile beautiful
with its sadness.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My dear child, if there were no folly
in the world it would be a stupid place,
and I for one should want to move,&#8217; I said.
&#8216;Some never discover their own follies, and
they <i>are</i> hopeless. You are as wise as you
are dear. It&#8217;s in your power to do a lot of
good. Think what you&#8217;ve already accomplished.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
I wish you would continue to
help us discourage foolish display in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are there any more chestnuts in the
fire?&#8217; she asked, with a laugh. &#8216;Not that
I&#8217;m afraid. I suppose the fire is good for
me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Marie, I love your fingers too well to
burn them unduly,&#8217; I said. &#8216;By the way,
I expect that Harry Delance will be wanting
to marry you soon.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Harry!&#8217; she exclaimed. &#8216;I talked him
to death&ndash;&ndash;and out of the notion&ndash;&ndash;long
ago, and I&#8217;m not sorry. He isn&#8217;t my
kind.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Harry&#8217;s a good fellow,&#8217; I insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But he&#8217;s so dreadfully nice&ndash;&ndash;such a
hopeless aristocrat! Grandfather would
have a fit. I want a big, full-blooded,
brawny chap, who isn&#8217;t a slave to his coat
and trousers&ndash;&ndash;the kind of man you&#8217;ve talked
so much about&ndash;&ndash;one who could get his
hands dirty and be a gentleman. I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
longing for the outdoor life&ndash;&ndash;and the outdoor
man to live it with me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Give Harry a chance&ndash;&ndash;his uneducation
had only just begun,&#8217; I urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I left Marie with a rather serious look
in her face, and began to wonder how I
should accomplish the uneducation of Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That young man came to see me, in a
day or two, at our home. My new set of
Smollett lay on the piano, and he greatly
admired it. Above all things Harry loved
books, and his specialty was Smollett; he
had read every tale in the series, at college,
and made a mark with his thesis on &#8216;The
Fathers of English Fiction.&#8217; He spent an
hour of delight with those books of mine.
Then he said to me:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Only fifty copies printed?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Only fifty,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Could I get a set?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All sold,&#8217; I assured him, &#8216;but I shall be
glad to give these books to you on two
conditions.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He turned in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They can do you no further harm, and
my first request is that you do not lend
them. My second is that you take them
home in my wheelbarrow by daylight with
your own hands.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He silently demurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;At last those books have a chance to
do some little good in the world, and I
don&#8217;t want them to lose it,&#8217; I urged. &#8216;The
hands, feet, and legs of the high and low
born are slowly being deprived of their
rights in this community. Pride is robbing
them of their ancient and proper offices.
How many of the young men and women of
our acquaintance would be seen on the
street with a package in their hands, to
say nothing of a wheelbarrow? Their
souls are above it!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why should they carry packages and
roll wheelbarrows?&#8217; Harry asked. &#8216;Stores
deliver goods these days.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s one reason why it costs so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
to live. We have to pay for our pride and
our indolence and the delivery of the goods.
It&#8217;s all charged in the bill. Some member
of the family used to go to market every
morning with his basket and carry the goods
home with him.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It would be ridiculous for me to do
that,&#8217; said Harry. &#8216;We&#8217;re able to pay the
bills.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But you&#8217;re doing a great injustice to
those who are not. You make the delivery
system a necessary thing, and those who
can&#8217;t afford it have to help you stand the
expense&ndash;&ndash;a gross injustice. I want you
to help me in this cause of the hand and
foot. Your example would be full of inspiration.
Excuse me a moment.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went for the wheelbarrow and rolled
it up to the front door. Then we brought
out the books and loaded them. That
done, I seized the handles of the barrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come on,&#8217; I said. &#8216;I&#8217;ll do the work&ndash;&ndash;you
share the disgrace with me.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My gray hairs were too much for
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No; give me the handles,&#8217; he insisted.
&#8216;If it won&#8217;t hurt you, it won&#8217;t hurt me&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
sure.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, in his silk hat and frock-coat and
spats, with a carnation in his buttonhole,
he seized the wheelbarrow like a
man, and away we went. I steered him
up the Main Street, and people began to
hail us with laughter from automobiles,
and to jest with us on the sidewalk, and
Marie came along with two other pretty
girls, and the barrow halted in a gale
of merriment.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What in the world are you doing?&#8217;
one of them asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s the remains of the late Mr.
Smollett,&#8217; I explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m setting an example to the young,&#8217;
said Harry, as he mopped his forehead.
&#8216;Couldn&#8217;t help it. I had to do this thing.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Great!&#8217; Marie exclaimed. &#8216;Simply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
great! I&#8217;m going to get me a wheelbarrow.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She would take hold of the handles
and try it, and went on half a block in
spite of our protests, creating much excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the first rude beginning of
The Basket and Wheelbarrow Brigade in
Pointview, of which I shall tell you later.
And now I shall explain my generosity&ndash;&ndash;it
can generally be explained&ndash;&ndash;and how
I came by the Smollett.&#8221;</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH BETSEY COMMITS AN INDISCRETION</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Christmas was approaching, and
Betsey said to me one day that she
had been guilty of a great extravagance.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know you will forgive me just this
once,&#8217; she went on. &#8216;My love for you is
so extravagant that I had to keep pace
with it. You&#8217;ve simply got to accept
something very grand.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can&#8217;t think of anything that I
need unless it&#8217;s a new jack-knife,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nonsense!&#8217; she exclaimed. &#8216;You&#8217;ve
got to let me spend some money for you.
I&#8217;ve been held down in the expression of
my affections as long as I can stand it.
I&#8217;ve doubled my charities since we were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
married, as a token of my gratitude, and
now I&#8217;ve a right to do something to please
myself.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All right! We&#8217;ll lift the lid,&#8217; I said.
&#8216;We can lie about it, I suppose, and cover
up our folly.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, of course we don&#8217;t have to tell
what it cost,&#8217; said Betsey; &#8216;and, Socrates,
you can&#8217;t expect to reform me in a year.
It&#8217;s taken half a lifetime to acquire my
follies.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one trouble with the whole
problem. You can&#8217;t tear down a structure
which has been slowly rising for
half a century in a day, or in many days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christmas arrived, and Betsey went
down-stairs with me and covered my eyes
in the hall and led me to the grand piano.
Then I was permitted to look, and there
was the most gorgeous set of books that
my eyes ever beheld&ndash;&ndash;a set of Smollett,
in lovely brown calf, decorated with magnificent
gold tooling! Yes, I love such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
things&ndash;&ndash;who doesn&#8217;t?&ndash;&ndash;and I gave Betsey
a great hug, and we sat down with tears
in our eyes to look at the pages of vellum
and the wonderful etchings which adorned
so many of them. They were charming.
I knew that the books had cost at least a
thousand dollars. Grandpa Smead looked
awfully stern in his gold frame on the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now don&#8217;t think too badly of me,&#8217;
she urged. &#8216;Every poor family within
twenty miles is eating dinner at my expense
this Christmas Day.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are the dearest girl in all the
land!&#8217; I said. &#8216;There&#8217;s nobody like you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I knew that you were fond of the
classics,&#8217; said Betsey, &#8216;so I consulted Harry
Delance, and he suggested that I should
give you a set of Smollett; said it would
renew your youth. You know he&#8217;s devoted
to Smollett.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And why shouldn&#8217;t we keep up with
Harry?&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, you know he took the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
prize in literature, and ought to have excellent
taste. Then the young man who
sold the set to me is working his way
through Yale. I was glad to help him, too;
he recommended these books&ndash;&ndash;said they
were moral and uplifting&ndash;&ndash;not at all like
the modern trash. He knew that we enjoyed
home reading. Mary will read them
aloud to us, and we&#8217;ll enjoy them together.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;This father of romance was not unknown
to me, and I did not share her
confidence in the joys ahead of us, but
said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a fine dinner Betsey wanted to
start in at once. We sat down by the
fireside while her secretary began to read
aloud from one of the treasured volumes.
I had not read the story, and chose it
as being the least likely to make trouble.
In a short time we came to rough going
and the young woman began to falter.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That will do,&#8217; said Betsey, suddenly,
as I tried to conceal my emotions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She took the book from the hands of
her secretary and read on in silence for a
minute or so.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My land!&#8217; she exclaimed, with a look
of horror. &#8216;That book would corrupt the
morals of John Bunyan.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never mind; John never lived in
Pointview,&#8217; I argued. &#8216;He didn&#8217;t have
a chance to get hardened.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Betsey had a determined look in her
face, and rang for the coachman.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll have them stored in the stable,&#8217;
said she, firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you don&#8217;t keep it locked, all the
women in the neighborhood&#8217;ll be in there,&#8217;
I warned her, knowing that she couldn&#8217;t
help telling her friends of what had happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s no reason why the men should
be unduly exposed,&#8217; said Betsey. &#8216;Poor
things! It&#8217;s my duty to protect <i>you</i> as
long as I can, Socrates.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised to get rid of the books
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
somehow, and persuaded her to let them
stay where they were until I had had
time to think about it. Then she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Socrates, forgive me. I didn&#8217;t mean
it, and I wanted to be so nice to you.
I guess it&#8217;s a just punishment for my extravagance.
I thought the modern novels
were bad enough. What can I do for
you now?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Always, when you&#8217;re in doubt, do
nothing,&#8217; I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, I know what I&#8217;ll do!&#8217; she exclaimed,
joyfully. &#8216;I&#8217;ll knit you a pair
of socks with my own hands.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Eureka!&#8217; I shouted. &#8216;Those socks shall
make footprints on the sands of time.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH SOCRATES ATTACKS THE WORST DOERS AND BEST SELLERS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;One evening, soon after that, Betsey
and I went to a party at Deacon
Benson&#8217;s. The Deacon is Marie&#8217;s grandfather&ndash;&ndash;a
strict, old-line Congregationalist.
The old gentleman owned some two hundred
acres in the very heart of Pointview and
about a mile of shore-front. In all the
buying and selling, he had refused to part
with an acre of his land, now worth at least
a million dollars. He had willed it all to
Marie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deacon Joe was a relic of Puritan days,
with shrewd eyes under heavy gray tufts,
and a mouth bent like a sickle, and whiskers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
under a strong chin, and lines in his face
that suggested the heart of a lion. In his
walks he was always accompanied by a
hickory cane and a bulldog whose countenance
and philosophy were like unto those
of the Deacon.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a perfectly honest man who had
joined the church with mental reservations.
He had reserved the right to employ certain
adjectives and nouns which had been
useful in Pointview since the days of the
pioneer, and which had grown more and more
indispensable to the opinions of an honest
man. The verb &#8216;to damn&#8217; in all its parts
and relations had been one of them. The
word &#8216;hell&#8217; was another. It represented a
thing of great conversational value, and he
recommended it with perfect frankness to
certain people. He loved hell and hard
cider, and hated Episcopalians. He loved
to tell how one Episcopalian had cheated
him in a horse trade, and how another had
never paid for a bushel of onions. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
was enough for him. He had always
thought them a loose, unprincipled lot with
no adequate respect for fire and brimstone.
But Deacon Joe was honest, and his word
was worth a hundred cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the Delances were Episcopalians
from away back&ndash;&ndash;High-Church Episcopalians,
at that. The old man had sniffed
a good deal when Harry began to pay attention
to Marie, and had come to see me
about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I eased his fears and appealed to his
avarice. Harry had too much money and
some follies, I confessed, but he was sound at
heart, and I had hope of making a strong
man of him, and of course his money might
be a great lever in his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Very well&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ll keep an eye on him,&#8217;
he snapped, and left me without another
word.</p>
<p>&#8220;After that Marie was allowed to go
out with the young man in his drag and
tandem.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Harry and his sister came to the party
at Deacon Joe&#8217;s, and brought with them a
late volume of D&#8217;Annunzio for Marie to
read. Harry wished to know if I had
read it, and gave us a talk on the realism of
this modern Italian author.</p>
<p>&#8220;Again I drew on the memoirs of Dr.
Godfrey Vogeldam Guph, and this time
I explained that the learned doctor had all
the talents but one. He never told a lie&ndash;&ndash;never
but once, and that was on his death-bed.
Yes, it was a little late, but still it
was in time to save his reputation, and,
possibly, even his soul. To a man of his
parts the truth had always been good
enough, and lying unnecessary. If he had
told a lie it wouldn&#8217;t have amounted to anything&ndash;&ndash;everybody
would have believed it.
He wouldn&#8217;t have got any credit&ndash;&ndash;poor
man! He had no more use for a lie than a
fish has for a mackintosh&ndash;&ndash;until he came to
his last touching words, which were delivered
to a minister and his sister Sophia, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
had been reading to him from a book of
D&#8217;Annunzio.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My chance has arrived at last,&#8217; he said
to Sophia, &#8216;and in order that I may make
the most of it, you will please send for a
minister.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The latter came, and, seeing the book,
asked the good man if he had read it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Alas! my friend, that it should be necessary
for me to tell a lie on my death-bed,&#8217;
said the Doctor. &#8216;But now, at last, I tell
it proudly and promptly. I have not read
that book.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And therein I do clearly see the truth,&#8217;
said the wise old minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Which is this,&#8217; the learned Doctor confessed.
&#8216;I have come to an hour when a lie,
and nothing but a lie, can show my sense of
shame. I solemnly swear that I have not
read it!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, at least you&#8217;re a noble liar,&#8217; said
the man of God. &#8216;I absolve you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I claim no credit&ndash;&ndash;I am only doing my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
duty,&#8217; said the good Doctor, with a sign of
ineffable peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I could get his attention,
I called Harry aside and whispered: &#8216;In
Heaven&#8217;s name, boy, get hold of that book
and hang on to it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why?&#8217; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You don&#8217;t know the old man as I do&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
why,&#8217; I said. &#8216;If he should happen
to read it, he&#8217;d go after you with his
grandfather&#8217;s sword the next time you
showed up here.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie stood near us, and I beckoned to
her, and she came to my side.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The book,&#8217; said Harry&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;would you let
me take it?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I took it to my grandfather, and he is
reading it in his room,&#8217; she answered.
&#8216;Shall I go and get it?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He won&#8217;t mind,&#8217; said Marie; &#8216;I&#8217;ll go
and get it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;And away she went.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She came back to us soon, a bit embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He seems to be very much interested
and&ndash;&ndash;and a little cross,&#8217; said she. &#8216;I
think he will bring it out to you soon.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry turned pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You look sick, old man,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m not feeling very well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and
I think I shall excuse myself and go home.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was danger of a scene, but he
got away unharmed. By and by the lionhearted
deacon came out of his room, asked
severely for &#8216;young Delance,&#8217; wandered
through the crowd, answered indignantly
a few inquiries about his health, and returned
to his lair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw that the Deacon was mad. New
New England had imprudently bumped
into old New England, and it was too soon
to estimate the damage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Honorable Socrates Potter laughed
as he filled his pipe, and resumed with an
attitude of ease and comfort;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit of a Puritan myself, although
I understood Harry better than did the Deacon.
The young people have been captured
by the frankness of the Latin races. They
call it emancipation. Travel and the higher
education have opened the storage vats of
foreign degeneracy and piped them into our
land. Certain young men who have been
&#8216;finished&#8217; abroad, where they filled their
souls with Latin lewdness, have turned it
into fiction and a source of profit. Women
buy their books and rush through them, and
only touch the low places. There they lie
entranced, thick as autumnal leaves that
strew the brooks in Vallombrosa. Like the
women in the sack of Ismail, they sit them
down and watch for the adultery to begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;The imagination of the old world seems
to have gone wild&ndash;&ndash;Oscar Wilde! How the
Oscars have thriven there since the first
of them went to jail!&ndash;&ndash;a degenerate dynasty!&ndash;&ndash;hiding
the stench of spiritual rot with
the perfume of faultless rhetoric, speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
the unspeakable with the tongues of angels
and of prophets! And mostly, my boy,
they have thriven on the dollars of American
women under the leadership of modern
culture. And, you know, the maiden follows
mama. She is an apologist of sublime
lewdness, of emancipated human caninity.
Now I am no prude. I can stand a fairly
strong touch of human nature. I can even
put up with a good deal of the frankness of
the cat and dog. But the frankness of
some modern authors makes me sorry that
Adam was a common ancestor of theirs
and mine. It&#8217;s a disgrace to Adam and the
whole human brotherhood. We sons of the
Puritans ought to get busy in the old cause.
Noah had the good sense to keep the animals
and the people apart, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve
always stood for.&#8221;</p>

<h3>IN WHICH SOCRATES ATTACKS THE HELMET AND THE BATTLE-AX</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Marie came to see us at our home next
morning and began to cry as soon as
she had sat down in the library. The
thing I had looked for had come to pass.
Her grandfather had dropped Harry from
his list, and warned him to keep off the rag-carpet.
There was to be no more prancing
around in the &#8216;toot-coach&#8217; and the &#8216;Harry-cart,&#8217;
as he called them, for Marie. In his
view it was the surest means of getting to
perdition. Harry was an idler, and he had
always found that an idle brain was the
devil&#8217;s workshop. Marie might be polite
to the young man, but she must keep her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
side of the road and see that there was
always plenty of room between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He&#8217;s so hateful,&#8217; Marie said of her
grandfather. &#8216;He made such a fuss about
our getting a crest that we&#8217;ve a perfect
right to! Mama had to give it up.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What! Do you mean to tell me that
you have no crest!&#8217; I inquired, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We have one, but we cannot use it; our
hands are tied,&#8217; was her sorrowful answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m astonished. Why, everybody is
going to have a crest in Pointview.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The other day I suggested to Bridget
Maloney, our pretty chambermaid, that
she ought to have the Maloney crest on her
letter-heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; says Bridget.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;What&#8217;s that!&#8221; I said, with a look of
pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then I showed her a letter from Mrs.
Van Alstyne, with a lion and a griffin
cuffing each other black and blue at the
top of the sheet.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;It&#8217;s grand!&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;It&#8217;s the Van Alstyne crest,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a proof of respectability. Aren&#8217;t you as
good as they are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Every bit!&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought. Don&#8217;t you
often feel as if you were better than a good
many people you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Sure I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a sign that you&#8217;re blue-blooded,&#8221;
said I. &#8220;Probably you&#8217;ve got
a king in your family somewhere. A
crest shows that you suspect your ancestors&ndash;&ndash;nothing
more than that. It isn&#8217;t
proof, so there&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t
have it. You ought not to be going around
without a crest, as if you were a common
servant-girl. Why, every kitchen-maid will
be thinking she&#8217;s as good as you are. You
want to be in style. You have money in
the bank, and not half the people who have
crests are as well able to afford &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;How much do they cost?&#8221;</p>

&#8220;&#8216;IT&#8217;S THE VAN ALSTYNE CREST,&#8217; I SAID. &#8216;IT&#8217;S A PROOF OF RESPECTABILITY.&#8217;&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Nothing&ndash;&ndash;at least, yours&#8217;ll cost nothing,
Bridget. I shall be glad to buy one
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The simple girl thanked me, and I
found the Maloney crest for her, and had
the plate made and neatly engraved on
a hundred sheets of paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Next week the Pointview <i>Advocate</i>
will print this item: &#8220;Miss Bridget Maloney,
the genial chambermaid of Mrs.
Socrates Potter, uses the Maloney crest
on her letter-heads. She is said to be a
lineal descendant of his Grace Bryan
Maloney, one of the early dukes of Ireland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bridget is haughty, well-mannered, and
a neat dresser. She&#8217;s a pace-maker in
her set. Even the high-headed servants
of Warburton House imitate her hats and
gowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yesterday Katie O&#8217;Neil, one of Mrs.
Warburton&#8217;s maids, came to me for information
as to the heraldry of her house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
I found a crest for Katie; and then came
Mary Maginness; and Bertha Schimpfelheim,
the daughter of a real German
count; and one August Bernheimer, a young
barber of baronial blood; and Pietro Cantaveri,
our prosperous bootblack, who was
the grandson of an Italian countess; and
so it goes, and soon all the high-born servers
of Pointview will be supplied with armorial
bearings.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;These claims to distinction shall be
soberly chronicled in the <i>Advocate</i>. Not
one is to be overlooked or treated with
any lack of respect. On the contrary,
the whole thing will be exploited with
a proper sense of awe.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wait till I tell mama,&#8217; she said. &#8216;It&#8217;s
lucky you told me. It&#8217;s saved us. I guess
grandfather was right about that.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And he&#8217;s right about Harry, too,&#8217; I said.
&#8216;But don&#8217;t despair; I&#8217;m trying to put a new
mainspring in the boy. If I succeed, your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
grandfather may have to change his
mind.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She went away comforted, but not
happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I went on with the crest campaign.
Bertha, Pietro, and the others got their
crests and saw their names in the paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;The supply of crests was soon perfectly
adequate, and among our best people the
demand for them began to diminish, and
suddenly ceased. The beast rampant and
couchant, the helmet and the battle-ax,
associated only with mixed tenses and misplaced
capitals according to their ancient
habit. This chambermaid grammar was
referred to by my friend, Dr. Guph, as the
&#8216;battle-ax brand&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;a designation of some
merit. Expensive stationery fell into the
fireplaces of Pointview, and armorial plates
were found in the garbage. The family
trees of the village were deserted. Not a
bird twittered in their branches. The subject
of genealogy was buried in deep silence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
save when the irreverent referred to some
late addition to our new aristocracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I want to make it clear that we
have no disrespect for the customs of any
foreign land. If I were living in a foreign
land and needed evidence of my respectability,
I&#8217;d have a crest, if it was likely to
prove my case. But America was founded
by the sons of the yeomen, and the yeomen
established their respectability with other
evidence. Their brains were so often touched
by the battle-ax that some of us have an
hereditary shyness about the head, and we
dodge at every baronial relic.&#8221;</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH SOCRATES INCREASES THE SUPPLY OF SPLENDOR</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;In due time the Society of Useful Women
met at our house, and I was invited to
make a few remarks, and said in effect:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We are trying to correct the evil of
extravagant display in America, and first
I ask you to consider the cause of it. We
find it in the ancient law of supply and demand.
The reason that women love to
array themselves in silk and laces and
jewels and picture-hats and plumes of
culture and sunbursts of genealogy lies in
the fact that the supply of these things has
generally been limited. Their cost is so
high, therefore, that few can afford them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
and those who wear them are distinguished
from the common herd. This matter of
buying distinction is the cause of our
trouble. Now I propose that we increase
the supply of jewels, silks, laces, picture-hats,
and ancestors in Pointview&ndash;&ndash;that we
bring them within the reach of all, and aim
a death-blow at the distinction to be obtained
by displaying them. There isn&#8217;t a
servant-girl in this community who doesn&#8217;t
pant for luxuries. Why shouldn&#8217;t she?
I move that we have a committee to consider
this inadequate supply of luxuries,
with the power to increase the same at its
own expense.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was appointed chairman of that committee,
and went to work, with Betsey and
Mrs. Warburton as coadjutors.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stocked a store with clever imitations
of silks, satins, and old lace, and the
best assortment of Brummagem jewelry
that could be raked together. We had a
great show-case full of glittering paste&ndash;&ndash;bracelets,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
tiaras, coronets, sunbursts, dog-collars,
rings, necklaces&ndash;&ndash;all extremely modish
and so handsome that they would have
deceived any but trained eyes. Our pearls
and sapphires were especially attractive.
We hired a skilled dressmaker, familiar
with the latest modes, and a milliner who
could imitate the most stunning hats on
Fifth Avenue at reasonable prices. Every
servant in good standing in our community
was permitted to come and see and buy and
say &#8216;Charge it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Warburton&#8217;s ball for the servants
of Pointview, to be given in the Town Hall,
was coming near. It happened that the
committee of arrangements included Marie
and the young Reverend Robert Knowles.
Their intimacy began in the work of that
committee. For days they rode about in
the minister&#8217;s motor-car getting ready for
the ball and for the greater intimacy that
followed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ball sent its radiance over land and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
sea. Sunbursts shone like stars in the Milky
Way. A fine orchestra furnished music.
Reporters from New York and other cities
were present.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nurses, cooks, kitchen-girls, laundresses,
and chambermaids of Pointview
were radiant in silk, lace, diamonds, pearls,
and rubies. The costumes were brilliant,
but all in good taste. Alabaster? Why,
my dear boy, they would have made the
swell set resemble a convention of beanpoles.
For the matter of busts, they busted
the record!</p>
<p>&#8220;The only mishap occurred when Bertha
Schimpfelheim&ndash;&ndash;some call her Big Bertha&ndash;&ndash;slipped
and fell in a waltz, injuring the
knee of her companion. To my surprise
the brainiest of these working-folk saw the
satire in which they were taking part, and
entered into it with all the more spirit
because they knew.</p>

&#8220;RADIANT IN SILK, LACE, DIAMONDS, PEARLS, AND RUBIES&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The presence of Mr. Warburton, Mr.
and Mrs. Delance, Marie, and the Reverend
Robert Knowles on the floor insured proper
decorum and lent an air of seriousness to
the event. It proved an effective background
for Marie. She shone like a pigeon-blood
ruby among garnets. She wore no
jewels, and was distinguished only by her
beauty and the simplicity of her costume
and the unmistakable evidence of good
breeding in her face and manners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry sat with me in the gallery.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She&#8217;s wonderful!&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;All
this rococo ware simply emphasizes her
charm. Only a girl of brains could carry
it off as she does. She&#8217;s among them and
yet apart. An old duke once told me that
if you want to know the rank of a lady, observe
how she treats an inferior. It&#8217;s quite
true. By Jove! I&#8217;m in love with Marie, and
I&#8217;m going to make her my wife if possible.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s one really substantial result
of the ball,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you think that she cares for Knowles&ndash;&ndash;that
minister chap?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m inclined to think that she likes you
better,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is your inclination encouraged by
evidence?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That query I must decline to answer,&#8217;
said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, you know, I&#8217;m not going to be
long in doubt,&#8217; the boy declared, as he left
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;The event was an epoch-maker. Long
reports of it appeared in the daily press
and traveled far in a surge of thoughtful
merriment. For instance: &#8216;Miss Mary
Maginness, the accomplished lady-in-waiting
of Mrs. William Warburton, of Warburton
House, wore a coronet and a dog-collar
of diamonds above a costume of white
brocaded satin, trimmed with old duchesse
lace and gold ornaments. Miss Maginness
is a lineal descendant of Lord Rawdon
Maginness, of Cork, who early in the seventeenth
century commanded an army that
drove the Italians out of Ireland.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And so it went, with column after
column of glittering detail. Since then
the servants have enjoyed a monopoly in
splendor&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s been a kind of Standard
Jewel Company, and certain rich men have
boasted in my presence that they haven&#8217;t a
jewel in their houses; and one added with
quite unneeded emphasis: &#8216;Not a measly
jewel. My wife says that they suggest
dish-water and aprons.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is too funny!&#8217; said Mrs. Warburton.
&#8216;You know those jewels at the ball were
quite as real as many that are worn by
ladies of fashion. Most rich women who
want to save themselves worry keep their
jewels in the strong-box and wear replicas
of paste and composition.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The instalment jeweler has gone out
of business, and half a dozen servant-girls
have refused to make further payments
on their solitaires and returned
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;One singular thing happened. Nearly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
all those servants paid their bills to our
store, and we closed out with an unexpected
profit, while a number of stores who charged
their goods to the noble band of employers
have stopped for need of money.&#8221;</p>

<h3>IN WHICH SOCRATES BREAKS THE DRAG AND TANDEM MONOPOLY IN POINTVIEW</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Harry&#8217;s father came often for a smoke
and talk with me after dinner, and his
favorite subject was Harry. As a subject
of conversation, Harry was more successful
than the average crime. In this respect
he resembled a divorce or a murder. That&#8217;s
how it happened that Harry got on my
mind. He is one of the most skilful riders
of the human mind that I know of. He was
wearing us out, and we were all bucking to
get him off. Well, his father was thinking
about him while I was thinking about the
rest of Pointview. It was another case of
Rome and C&aelig;sar. Harry&#8217;s last achievement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
was to accuse his father of being the
fossiliferous remnant of an ancient time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The truth is, Harry hasn&#8217;t enough
competition in his line,&#8217; I suggested, one
evening. &#8216;The other boys are doing well,
but they don&#8217;t keep up with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You know after I left college, in my
youth, I spent a couple of years in Wyoming.
Well, Mary Ann Crowder was the
only single lady within a hundred miles,
and she was the most obstreperous damn
critter that I ever saw. She had a monopoly
an&#8217; knew it, an&#8217; wasn&#8217;t decently polite.
Put on more style than a nigger at a cakewalk.
Though she had red hair an&#8217; only
one eye, some of the boys used to ride sixty
miles for a visit with her. Then they had
to swim the Snake River and maybe wrestle
with a tame bear that was loose in the dooryard.
By and by a man with two unmarried
daughters moved on to a ranch
near us, and then Mary Ann began to be
polite. She suddenly became a human
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
being, an&#8217; killed the bear, an&#8217; moved across
the river an&#8217; married the first man that
proposed, and lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What we need here is another drag
and tandem.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Get what you need, and I&#8217;ll pay the
bills,&#8217; said Harry&#8217;s father.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I went to a sale in New York, bought
my drag and tandem-cart, and had them
shipped to Pointview. Our local sign-painter
put a crest or, rather, a kind of
royal hatchment, on the panels of both.
Then I sold them for next to nothing to a
local livery on conditions. Its new owner
agreed to use the drag for chowder-parties,
and to break the worst-looking nags in his
stable to drive tandem on the cart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tommy Ruggles, a smart-looking knight
of the currycomb, whose first name was a
kitchen word in Pointview, sprang to my
assistance. He had curly hair, and a good
deal of natural cuteness, and was, moreover,
&#8216;a divvle with the girls.&#8217; He contracted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
with me to take a selected list of
female servants for an airing in the tandem-cart.
He was to get a royalty of five dollars
a head on every servant that was properly
aired, with a small premium on red ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;He began with Big Bertha, our worthy
German countess. Tommy had a playful
humor, and cracked his long whip over the
rough-harnessed nags and merrily tooted
his horn as the rig lumbered along through
the main streets of our village. Many
laughed and many wondered, while an army
of noisy kids followed and hung on behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tommy got his second girl, who was
hit on the head with a ripe tomato, and
then it was all over. The girls wouldn&#8217;t
stand for it. The sport had become too
exciting. Tommy told me how he had invited
Bridget Maloney, and she had said:
&#8216;Na-a-ah! Do yez take me for an idiot?
Sure every rotten egg in the town would
be jumpin&#8217; at me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It suggested an idea. As the imitation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
idiots had given out, we would try the real
thing. So I &#8217;phoned the manager of our
thriving idiot asylum on the Post Road
and arranged to have Tommy take one of
his patients every day for a drive in the
cart. Why shouldn&#8217;t all the idiots enjoy
themselves? Fresh air would be good for
them. It would turn the cart into a charity
which would cover a part of my sins. I
asked for the better class of idiots&ndash;&ndash;the
quiet ones, who had sense enough to appreciate
a good thing. The parade began
and continued day after day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry had retired his tandem after
Tom, with a stiff-backed idiot by his side,
had clattered after him through the village
behind the two spavined nags to the amusement
of many people. He had kept up
with Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon that kind of a rig was known as the
Idiot Wagon. Then Tommy resigned; it
was more than he could stand. He said
he was willing to do any honest work for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
money, but not that. He said that the
idiots imagined themselves rich, and put
on so much style that it made the whole
thing ridiculous.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never mind&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s the habit of idiots,&#8217;
I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;One of &#8217;em thinks he&#8217;s Napoleon
Bonaparte, an&#8217; calls me his man, and wears
a plug hat and sits as straight as a ramrod,
and bows to the people when they laugh
at him,&#8217; said Tommy. &#8216;Some of &#8217;em get
stuck on the cart, and it&#8217;s a fight to get &#8217;em
out of it. I tell ye, I&#8217;m sick o&#8217; the job.
The sight o&#8217; that cart makes me feel
nutty.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never mind, Tom,&#8217; I said; &#8216;you&#8217;ve
been a public benefactor, and you and the
cart are entitled to an honorable discharge.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every bright day the drag was tooling
over the road with picnic-parties on their
way to one of the popular beaches. Our
local lodges and political clubs, and now
and then a load of Italians, were able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
enjoy the luxury which had been the exclusive
delight of Harry and the fluffy
maidens of Pointview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drags an&#8217; tandems are all right if you
don&#8217;t go too far with &#8217;em. We were just
in time to prevent them from becoming
tools of degeneration in our village.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH SUNDRY PEOPLE MAKE GREAT DISCOVERIES</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;There were many private panics in
Pointview. It was my privilege to
observe, under calm exteriors, a raging fever
of excitement&ndash;&ndash;characters going bankrupt,
collectors wandering in a fruitless quest.
One little rill that flowed into the swift
river of national trouble issued from the
bosom of my clerk, Mr. &#8216;Cub&#8217; Sayles.
It had been one of the most placid bosoms
in Pointview. Now it was in the midst
of what I have since referred to as the
&#8216;Violet and Supper Panic of 1907.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cub was a quiet, hard-working, serious-minded
boy whose mother moved in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
higher circles of Boston. He had a low,
pleasant voice, a touch of Harry&#8217;s dialect,
and a sad face. He had asked for a higher
salary, and I had asked for information.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You see every time I go to call on my
girl I have to take a bunch of violets or a
two-pound box of candy,&#8217; he said. &#8216;Then
if we go to the theater her chaperon has
to be with us&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you know? She&#8217;s
a stout lady who complains of faintness
before the play ends, and I have to ask
them out to supper. Then I am always
greatly alarmed, for you never can tell what
will happen, sir, with two ladies at supper
and only twenty dollars in your pocket,
and both ladies fond of game and crab-meat.
It&#8217;s really very trying. I sit and tremble as
I watch them, and go home with only a
feeble remnant of my salary, and next day
I have to pawn my diamond ring.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All that isn&#8217;t honest,&#8217; I said. &#8216;You&#8217;re
getting her favor under false pretenses.
You&#8217;re trying to make her believe that you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
are a sort of aristocrat with lots of money.
Why don&#8217;t you tell her the truth&ndash;&ndash;that you
can&#8217;t afford violets, that the two-pound
box is a burden that is breaking your back,
and that every theater-supper sends you
to the pawnbroker&#8217;s?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;she would throw me over,&#8217;
he explained. &#8216;The girls expect those
things. They like to show and talk about
them&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you know? It&#8217;s the fashion.
Our best young men do it, sir.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, if you are willing to give up your
honor for a lady&#8217;s smile you won&#8217;t do for
me,&#8217; I said. &#8216;You must not only tell the
truth, but live it. You must be just what
you are&ndash;&ndash;a poor boy working for twenty
dollars a week. If the girl doesn&#8217;t like
it she&#8217;s unfit to associate with honest
men. If you don&#8217;t like it I don&#8217;t like
you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perspiration had begun to dampen the
brow of Cub.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&ndash;&ndash;I hadn&#8217;t seen it in that light, sir,&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
he said. &#8216;But what am I to do, sir? I am
heavily indebted to my tailor.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What! Haven&#8217;t you paid for those
lovely garments?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I had them charged, sir,&#8217; Cub sadly
answered. &#8216;My mother sent me a hundred
dollars to pay for them, but I loaned it to
Roger Daniels. I should be much obliged,
sir, if you would collect it for me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to Roger and made him pay the
debt. He paid it in a curious way&ndash;&ndash;by going
to his tailor and buying a hundred
dollars&#8217; worth of clothes for Cub and having
them charged. It was compounding
a felony, but my client was satisfied and
Roger was grateful. He began to have some
regard for me. Not every lawyer had been
able to make him pay. Within a day or
so he came to consult me about a mortgage
on his patrimony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger had married and settled down
immediately after his remarkable cruise.
He had kept his party in ignorance of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
financial troubles and returned with his reputation
as an aristocrat firmly established.
The gay young Bessie Runnymede had
accepted him at once. He had become
junior partner in a firm of brokers and had
rented a handsome residence in Pointview.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they began their little play with
ladies, lords, and gentlemen in the cast, and
with a country-house, a tandem, a crested
limousine, and a racing launch for scenery.
But Roger had what is known as a bad
season. Well, you know, the moving-picture
shows had got such a hold on the
public.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first we concluded that he must
have made another lucky play in the market.
Then, after six months or so, bills against
Roger began to arrive for collection from
sundry department stores in the city. He
was a good fellow and had plausible excuses,
and I declined to press payment and returned
the bills.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, some eight months after the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
wedding, an urgent telegram from Roger
brought me to New York. I found the
young man in his office, with his wife at his
side. They were both in tears. I sat down
with them, and he told me this story:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The fact is, I&#8217;m a thief,&#8217; he began.
&#8216;I have confessed the truth to my partners.
Since my marriage I have taken about
twenty thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;needed every
cent of it to keep going. The fact is, I
expected to make a killing in the market
and return the money&ndash;&ndash;had inside information&ndash;&ndash;but
everything went wrong. Yesterday
I was cleaned out.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I went home late in the evening. I
hoped that my wife would be in bed, but
she was waiting for me. She said that
I looked sick, and wanted to know what was
the matter. I told her that I had a headache,
and got into bed as soon as possible;
but I couldn&#8217;t sleep. Long after midnight
my wife rose and turned on the light and
came to my bed and said that she knew I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
was troubled about something&ndash;&ndash;that she
had seen it in my face for weeks. She
begged that I would let her help me bear it.
Then I told her the truth, and discovered&ndash;&ndash;for
I didn&#8217;t know her before&ndash;&ndash;one of the
noblest women in the world. She hid her
face in the pillow, and then I had a bad
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Why did you do it?&#8221; she asked as soon
as she could speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And I said: &#8220;We&#8217;ve been foolish&ndash;&ndash;trying
to keep up with Harry and the rest
of them. It was my fault. I ought to
have told you that I couldn&#8217;t go the
pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She saw the truth in a flash, and the
old-fashioned woman in her got to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Roger, get up and dress yourself,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;We will go and see your partners
to-night. We will go together, for I am as
guilty as you. We will tell them the truth
and beg for time. Maybe we can get the
money.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We started in our motor-car about one
o&#8217;clock for the city, on dark and muddy
roads. Some ten miles out we broke an
axle and left car and driver and went on
afoot. My wife wouldn&#8217;t wait. No trains
were running. But we could get a trolley
five miles down the road. So we went on
in the dark and silence. I put my arm
around her, and not a word passed between
us for an hour or so. I don&#8217;t know what she
was thinking of, but I was trying to count
my follies. It began to rain, and I felt
sorry for Bess, and took off my coat and
threw it over her.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind the rain,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It
will cool me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We were a sight when we got to the
trolley, and just before daylight we rang
the bell of the senior partner. Our weariness
and muddy shoes and rain-soaked garments
were a help to us. They touched his heart,
sir. Anyhow, he gave me a week of grace
in which to make good. I must get the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
money somehow, and I want your advice
about it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m glad of one part of it all,&#8217; I said&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;that
you have discovered each other and
learned that you are human beings of a
pretty good sort. I&#8217;ve much more respect
for both of you than I ever had before.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He looked at me in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, you are a better man than you were
three months ago!&#8217; I answered him. &#8216;You
happen to have run against the law, and it&#8217;s
shocked and frightened you. But you are
improving. Long ago you began to incur
debts which you couldn&#8217;t pay, and you must
have known that you couldn&#8217;t pay them.
In that manner you became possessed of
a large sum of money belonging to other
people. It was used not for necessities,
but to maintain a foolish display. That is
the most heartless kind of fraud. I&#8217;ve
much more respect for you now that you
see your fault and confess it. I&#8217;m convinced
now that you have a conscience,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
and that you will be likely to make some use
of it in the future. I&#8217;m particularly grateful
to your wife. She has shown me that
she is just a woman, and not an angel. I
don&#8217;t believe that it was at all necessary for
you to have groveled in aristocratic crimes
in order to win her heart. The yacht cruise
and the tandem and the violets and the
Fifth Avenue clothes and the ton of candy
were quite superfluous. You needed only
to tell her the truth, like a man, and say
that you loved her.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is true, Roger,&#8217; said the girl as she
broke down again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I did it all to please you, dear,&#8217; the boy
answered, in his effort to comfort her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And it did please me,&#8217; she said, brokenly,
&#8216;but I know that I should have been
better pleased if&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She hesitated, and I expressed her
thought for her:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;If he had centralized on manhood.
There is something sweeter than violets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
and grander than fine raiment in a sort of
character that a boy should offer to the
girl he loves.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were both convinced. It was
easy to see that now, and I promised to do
what I could for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got a schedule of the young man&#8217;s
debts and found that he owed, among other
debts, six thousand dollars to sundry shops
and department stores in New York&ndash;&ndash;the
purchases of his wife in the eight months
of their wedded life. I asked her how it
could have happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He opened accounts for me and said
I could buy what I wanted, and you know
it is so easy to say &#8220;Charge it,&#8217;&#8221; was her
answer. &#8216;Every one has accounts these
days, and they tempt you to buy more
than you need.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is true. Credit is the latest ally of
the devil. It is the great tempter. It is
responsible for half the extravagance of
modern life. The two words &#8216;charge it&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
have done more harm than any others in
the language. They have led to a vast
amount of unnecessary buying. They have
developed a talent for extravagance in our
people. They have created a large and
growing sisterhood and brotherhood of
dead-beats. They have led to bankruptcy
and slow pay and bad debts. They have
raised the cost of everything we require
because the tradesman compels us to pay
his uncollected accounts. They are added
to your bills and mine, and the merchant
prince suffers no impairment of his fortune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bessie&#8217;s bank-account was also overdrawn.
That reminds me of a new sinner&ndash;&ndash;the
bank-check. It is so easy to draw a
check&ndash;&ndash;and, then, somehow, it&#8217;s only a piece
of paper. You let it go without a pang while
you would be very thoughtful if you were
counting out the money and parting with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The check is another way of saying
&#8216;Charge it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;That evening I went to see Harry.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH HARRY IS FORCED TO ABANDON SWAMP FICTION AND LIKE FOLLIES AND TO STUDY THE GEOGRAPHY AND NATIVES OF A LAND UNKNOWN TO OUR HEIRISTOCRACY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I found Harry smoking with Cub
Sayles in his den above stairs in the big
country-house of Henry Delance. As I
entered Harry said to his young friend:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have to talk over some things with
Mr. Potter&ndash;&ndash;would you mind going down
to the library?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cub withdrew, and Harry sat down with
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I suppose you&#8217;ve seen him?&#8217; he asked,
nervously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whom?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, you know a mysterious stranger
has been looking for me and&ndash;&ndash;by Jove!&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
scared stiff. He&#8217;s an Englishman.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What of that?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me show you,&#8217; said Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;He took a key from his pocket, unlocked
a door, and fetched the familiar skull of
the Bishop of St. Clare and put it on the
table before me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s that damn Bishop&#8217;s head,&#8217; he whispered.
&#8216;It has come back&ndash;&ndash;would you
believe it?&ndash;&ndash;picked up by a fisherman on
the Irish coast and returned to the express
office in London. All the old directions
were quite legible on the box. &#8220;To Harry
Delance, SS. <i>Lusitania</i>. If not found, forward
to Pointview, Conn., U.S.A., charges
collect!&#8221; So it came on. I received a
notice and went down and got it out of
bond and paid three pounds, and here it is.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It looks as if the Bishop was out for
revenge,&#8217; I said, with a laugh.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He&#8217;s got on my nerves and my conscience,&#8217;
said Harry. &#8216;By Jove! he haunts
me. When I heard of this mysterious
Englishman to-day I got a chill.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You go buy yourself a small shovel
and a pocket light to-morrow,&#8217; I suggested,
and at night go back in the hills with the
Bishop&#8217;s head and bury it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And if I get into trouble I want you
to take care of me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made no answer. It didn&#8217;t seem
necessary, but I said: &#8216;There&#8217;s another
matter of which I have come to talk with
you. Our friend Roger is in trouble.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him the story of Roger&#8217;s downfall.
It got under his vest, and I added:
&#8216;Now, Harry, it&#8217;s up to you to indulge in
some more philanthropy. You ought to
help him.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&ndash;&ndash;what can I do?&#8217; he asked in
amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lend him the money&ndash;&ndash;twenty thousand
dollars. It isn&#8217;t all that the public
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
will charge against you on Roger&#8217;s account,
but it will do.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Harry sank in his chair and threw up
his hands as if grasping for a straw.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s my whole allowance for the year,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;and I couldn&#8217;t appeal to the Governor.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nevertheless you ought to do it, for
Roger told me that it was your pace that
brought him where he is.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What an ass!&#8217; Harry exclaimed, and
the old Bishop seemed to indorse his view.
&#8216;By the blue beard of the Caliph, what am
I to do?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pay it,&#8217; I insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pay it and die,&#8217; he groaned. &#8216;I shall
have to do it somehow, but this kind of
thing is grinding me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You can go to my ranch in Wyoming
and live on nothing for six months,&#8217; I said.
&#8216;When you get back I&#8217;ll lend you enough
to tide you over!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8217; he said, as if it were the very
straw he had been reaching for.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then he began to tell me of other
troubles. Marie had been decidedly cool
to Harry at the servants&#8217; ball. Then he
had met her on the street, and she had
barely noticed him and hurried away, with
the young Reverend Robert Knowles at
her side. Harry was, fortunately, going
slow, but he had received internal injuries
and was suffering from shock.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The old man is at the bottom of it,&#8217;
I explained. &#8216;You gave him a dose from
the wrong bottle. It p&#8217;isoned him.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;By Jove! What a prude he is!&#8217; said
Harry. &#8216;Upon my word that is one of the
noblest books I ever read&ndash;&ndash;contains a
great lesson, don&#8217;t you know? It takes
you straight to the heights.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Too straight,&#8217; I said. &#8216;It turns out
for nothing. It crosses a morass to avoid
going around. When you reach the high
ground you are covered with mud and
slime. You need to be washed and disinfected,
and perhaps you&#8217;ve caught a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
fever that will last as long as you live.
Many a boy and girl have got mired in
this swamp fiction that you enjoy so much.
There are many of us who prefer to go
around the swamp and keep on a decent
footing even if it takes longer.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We want to know all sides of life,&#8217; said
Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And would you care to see the girl
you loved studying life in a brothel?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, really, you know, that&#8217;s different,&#8217;
Harry stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But the fact is, her feet might as well
be in a brothel as her brain,&#8217; I insisted.
&#8216;She might shake the dust from her <i>feet</i>.
Harry, there&#8217;s one side of life that you
ought to study at once&ndash;&ndash;the American side.
You&#8217;ve neglected the Western hemisphere
in your studies. When can you start for
the ranch?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Day after to-morrow&ndash;&ndash;if you like.
This place is a dreadful bore.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good! I&#8217;ll attend to the tickets to-day,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
The cart, drag, and horses will be
all the better for a vacation, and the eyes of
the people are in need of rest.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The whole outfit is going to be sold,&#8221;
said Harry. &#8216;Idiots and the hoi polloi
have quite ruined the sport here. The
Governor is always poking fun at it, you
know, and it has made me so weary! One
can&#8217;t stand that kind of thing forever&ndash;&ndash;can
he? I got after his helmet, battle-ax,
and family tree, by Jove! Our crested
chambermaids and bootblacks have been
a great help to me. What a noble band of
philanthropists! Father and I have made
an agreement. He is going to chuck the
battle-ax and saw the royal branches off
our family tree and I am going to sell the
drag, cart, and horses.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s a great treaty,&#8217; I said. &#8216;The
settlement of the Alaskan frontier is not
more important than fixing the boundaries
of our social life. Let us surrender the tools
of idiocy; especially, let us abandon all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
claim to the helmet and battle-ax. They&#8217;re
all right in their place, but they aren&#8217;t ours.
The plowshare and the pruning-hook are
our symbols.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;By Jove! you know, the old Bishop of
St. Clare agrees with you exactly,&#8217; said
Harry. &#8216;I&#8217;ve been reading his life and
writings, which I picked up in London,
and he&#8217;s about converted me to your way of
thinking. He hated &#8220;the glittering idleness&#8221;
of the rich and put industry above
elegance.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And he doesn&#8217;t intend that your
education shall be neglected&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s looking
after you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He&#8217;s as industrious as Destiny,&#8217; said
the young man. &#8216;Did you know that Cub
Sayles is engaged?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To whom?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mrs. Revere-Chalmers.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;God rest his soul!&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s just the thing for Cub,&#8217; said
Harry. &#8216;He&#8217;s poor but presentable, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
has many extravagant tastes. She&#8217;s quite
a bit older than he, of course, but that isn&#8217;t
unusual.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I warned him long ago, knowing that
his folly would undo him. Now he will be
a captain of New Thought, King of the
Flub Dubs, advertising manager of the
Psychological Hair Factory, and inspector
of pimples.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But don&#8217;t you know that he will have
everything that he desires?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Except happiness.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, I think that she is very fond of
him!&#8217; said Harry. &#8216;She told me to-day
that he is the only man she ever loved, and
the dear old girl thinks that she won him
by concentration.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;With this remark, made on the 20th of
May, Harry dropped out of the history of
Pointview until December.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH THE MINISTER GETS INTO LOVE AND TROUBLE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Cub resigned his place in my office
next day, and confessed his purpose,
and I heard him with sober respect and
tried in every proper way to save him. It
wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lines of panic had left the face of
Cub. The two-pound expression had departed
from it. The faintness of chaperons
would no longer imperil his comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A hundred and four pounds of candy
and twenty suppers, and all for nothing!&#8217;
I exclaimed. &#8216;You ruin a girl&#8217;s digestion
and chuck her over. It isn&#8217;t fair.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But, sir, I found that I didn&#8217;t love
her,&#8217; said Cub.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What a waste of violets, confectionery,
and crab-meat!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, sir, in a way; but you see I had
to have my training in society,&#8217; Cub declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the use? Cub had no more
humor than a sewing-machine.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The wedding day drew on apace, and
just before its arrival a notorious weekly
in New York gave the lady a drubbing.
Certain circumstances that made her first
marriage unhappy were plainly hinted at.
The town shuddered with amazement.
Cub stood pat, but the Episcopal minister
refused to marry them. The Baptist minister
balked. It looked like a postponement,
but the knot was tied, on schedule
time, by the Reverend Robert Knowles.
That made no end of talk, and a small
party of insurgents left his church. Deacon
Benson was on the point of pulling out, and
swore so much about it that I advised him
to hang on for his own sake.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But there ain&#8217;t much to hang on to,&#8217;
said the Deacon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mrs. Revere-Chalmers-Sayles held a
mortgage on the property of the Baptist
Society of Pointview, and asked me to foreclose
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have another mortgage on the Congregational
church, and they&#8217;re behind
in their interest, but I&#8217;m not going to push
them,&#8217; she said to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;So young Mr. Knowles had acted from
motives of business prudence, and was not
much at fault. The old church had ceased
to live within its means and had entered
the &#8216;charge it&#8217; van, and was trying to serve
two masters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Betsey and I paid both mortgages and
threw them in the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young Mr. Knowles came to see us
with Marie, and brought the thanks of the
parish. They were a good-looking couple.</p>
<p>&#8220;This minister of the First Congregational
Church of Pointview now aspired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
to be the prime minister of its first heiress.
Their acquaintance, which had begun in
the arrangements for the servants&#8217; ball,
had grown in warmth and intimacy as soon
as Harry had gone. Robert began to take
after Marie, with muffler open and all the
gas on. He was a swell of a parson&ndash;&ndash;utterly
damned with good-fortune. Had an income
from the estate of his father, a call
from on high, a crest from Charlemagne,
diplomas from college and the seminary, a
fine figure, red cheeks, and &#8216;heavenly eyes.&#8217;
As to his fatal gift of beauty, the young
ladies were of one mind. They agreed,
also, about the cut of his garments, that
were changed several times a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dashing, masculine, head-punching
spirit might have saved him with all his
ballast, but he didn&#8217;t have it. The Reverend
Robert was a good fellow to everybody&ndash;&ndash;a
fairly sound-hearted, decent, handsome
fellow, but not a man. To be that,
one has to know things at first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
hand&ndash;&ndash;especially work and trouble. He was a
second-hand, school-made thinker. His doctrines
came out of the books, but his conduct
was mildly modern. He danced and
smoked a little, and played bridge and golf,
and made his visits in a handsome motor-car.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie liked the young man, and she
and her mother rode and tramped about
with him almost every day of that summer.
Deacon Joe showed signs of faintness when
he spoke of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day I went up to the Benson homestead
and found the old man sitting on his
piazza alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where&#8217;s Marie?&#8217; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Off knocking around with the minister,&#8217;
said Deacon Joe, in a voice frail with contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;She might be in worse company,&#8217;
I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Maybe,&#8217; he snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with the minister?&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nothing,&#8217; said the old man, with a
chuckle. &#8216;He&#8217;s a complete gentleman, complete!
So plaguy beautiful that he&#8217;s a kind
of a girl&#8217;s plaything. He couldn&#8217;t milk a
cow or dig a hill o&#8217; potatoes. Acts kind o&#8217;
faint an&#8217; sickly to me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Deacon thoughtfully stirred the
roots of his beard with the fingers of his
right hand, and went on with a squint and
a feeble tone which he seemed to think
best suited to his subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Talks so low you can hardly hear him.
I have to set with my hand to my ear every
Sunday to make out what he&#8217;s sayin&#8217;,
an&#8217; he prays as if he had the lung fever.
Talks o&#8217; hell as though it was a quart o&#8217;
cold molasses. That&#8217;s one reason we ain&#8217;t
no respect for it in this community. Ay&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;es!
That&#8217;s the reason.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He squinted his face thoughtfully and
resumed with more energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I like to hear a man get up on his
hind legs and holler as they used to&ndash;&ndash;by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
gravy! Ye can&#8217;t scare anybody by whispers.
Damn it, sir, what we need is an
old-fashioned revival.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Deacon halted to take a chew of
tobacco, and went on, with a sorrowful
calmness:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now this young feller don&#8217;t want to
give no credit to God&ndash;&ndash;not a bit&ndash;&ndash;no, sir!
Science has done everything. I&#8217;ve noticed
it time an&#8217; ag&#8217;in. T&#8217;other Sunday he said
that an angel spoke to Moses, an&#8217; the Bible
says, as plain as A B C, that God spoke to
him. How can he expect that God is
going to bless his ministry, an&#8217; he never
givin&#8217; Him any credit?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s rather bad politics, anyhow,&#8217; I
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;An&#8217; the church is goin&#8217; from bad to
worse,&#8217; he complained. &#8216;The average attendance
is about forty-seven, an&#8217; it used to
be between five an&#8217; six hundred, an&#8217; we
are all taxed to death to keep it goin&#8217;. I
have to pay three hundred a year for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
privilege o&#8217; gittin&#8217; mad every Sunday.
Two or three of us have got after him an&#8217;
made him promise to do better. Some
awful free-minded folks have crept into
the church, an&#8217; the fact is, we need their
money,&#8217; Deacon Joe went on. &#8216;What the
minister ought to do is stick to the old
doctrines that are safe an&#8217; sound. &#8216;St&#8217;id o&#8217;
that he&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to sail &#8217;twixt rock an&#8217; reef.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Between Scylla and Charybdis,&#8217; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Between Silly an&#8217; what?&#8217; the old man
asked, as if in doubt of my meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were interrupted by the arrival
of the Reverend Robert with Marie and her
mother, in his handsome landaulet. Marie
asked me to go with her to gather wild
flowers in a bit of woodland not far away.
I went, and soon saw her purpose. She
had had the &#8216;jolliest, cutest letter from
Harry&#8217; that she had ever read, and seemed
to be in doubt as to whether she ought to
let him write to her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Has your grandfather forbidden it?&#8217;
I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then it&#8217;s up to you,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you think he cares for me?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I should think him a fool if he didn&#8217;t,&#8217;
I said, looking down into her lovely dark
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But do you really and truly think that
he cares for me?&#8217; she insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I suspect that he does.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A lawyer must not betray a confidence.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you like him?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wait until his uneducation is completed,
and I&#8217;ll tell you. I am beginning to
have hope for Harry.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry grandpapa is so hateful!&#8217;
she exclaimed, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stood up for the old man and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you like the Reverend Robert?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Very much! He&#8217;s so good-looking,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
and has such beautiful thoughts! Have
you heard him preach?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We think his sermons are fine. Everybody
likes them but grandpapa. He wants
noise, you know&ndash;&ndash;lung power and old
theology. I hate it!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He doesn&#8217;t take to Robert?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No; he calls him a calf. Nobody is
good enough for me, you know. He&#8217;d like
me to marry some man with a hoe, who
would take me to church and Sunday school
every sabbath morning, and for a
walk to the cemetery in the afternoon, and
down to the prayer-meeting every Wednesday
night, and on a journey from Genesis
to Revelations once a year. It&#8217;s too much
to expect of a human being. Then the
hoes are in the hands of Poles, Slavs, and
Italians. So what am I to do?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, you are young&ndash;&ndash;you can afford
to wait a while,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But not until I am old and all withered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
up. I am going to marry the man I love
within a year or so, if he has the good sense
to ask me. Don&#8217;t you ever go to church?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why not?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to think. There were the
ministers&ndash;&ndash;two boys and three old men&ndash;&ndash;dried
beef and veal! Not to my knowledge
had a single one of them ever expressed an
idea. They were seen, but not felt. The
Church! Why, certainly, it was founded
on the sweetness, strength, and sanity of
a great soul. I had almost forgotten that.
It had grown feeble. It had got its fortunes
entangled in psychological hair. It
should have been correcting the follies of
the people&ndash;&ndash;their selfishness, their sinful
pride, their extravagance, their loss of honor
and humanity. Had I not seen, in the case
of Harry and his followers, how the Church
had failed in its work? Ought it not to
have sought and saved them long ago&ndash;&ndash;saved
them from needless disaster? It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
should have been appealing to their consciences.
If appeals had failed it should
have stung them with ridicule or raised
a voice like that of Christ against the
Pharisees. The Church! Why, it was living,
not in the present, but in the past. Here
in Pointview the Church itself had become
one of the greatest follies of the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I want you to go next Sunday and hear
Mr. Knowles, as a favor to me&ndash;&ndash;won&#8217;t
you?&#8217; Marie asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; I said. &#8216;In the next five Sundays
I shall go to every Protestant church in
Pointview. I want to know what they&#8217;re
doing. I shall put aside my scruples and
go.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH SOCRATES DISCOVERS A NEW FOLLY</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I went and saw the Reverend
Robert Knowles sail between &#8216;Silly
and Charybdis.&#8217; He bumped on both
sides, but did it rather gracefully. He reviewed
the career of Samuel, who lived and
died some thousands of years ago. The
miraculous touch of Carlyle or Macaulay
might easily have failed in the task of reviving
a man so thoroughly dead. But
the Reverend Robert entered this unequal
contest with no evidence of alarm. The
dead man prevailed. The power of his long
sleep fell upon us. My head grew heavy.
I felt my weight bearing down upon the
cushions. A stiffness came into my bones.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&#8220;On our way to church Betsey had
placed the young minister in my thoughts.
The trustees had reckoned that he would
revive the interest of the young people in
Sunday worship; and he did, but it was
the worship of youth and beauty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the other churches were emptier
than ever, and so the spiritual life of the
community was in no way improved. In
fact, I guess it had been a little embittered
by the new conditions. As soon as it became
known that Marie had won the prize
of his favor the other girls had returned to
their native altars, having discovered that
the new minister was vain, worldly, and
conceited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lettie Davis, who had made a dead set
at him, had been strongly convinced of
that as soon as he began to show a preference
for Marie, and the Davis family
had left the church and gone over to the
Methodists. The young man had been
filled with alarm. He feared it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
wreck the church. That old ship of the
faith was leaky and iron-sick, and down
by the head and heel, as they say at sea.
She rolled if one got off or on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such was the condition of things when
we entered the church of my fathers. We
sat down in the Potter pew a few minutes
before the service began. There were, by
actual count, forty-nine people gathered
around the altar of the old church, and behind
us a great emptiness and the ghosts
of the dead. In my boyhood I had sat
in its dim light, with six hundred people
filling every seat to the doors and a man of
power and learning in the pulpit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faces long forgotten were there in those
pews&ndash;&ndash;old faces, young faces. How many
thousands had left its altar to find distant
homes or to go on their last journey to that
nearer one in the churchyard! My heart
was full and ready for strong meat, but none
came to me. The moment of silence had
been something rare&ndash;&ndash;like an old Grecian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
vase wonderfully wrought. Then, suddenly,
the singing fell upon us and broke
the silence into ruins. It was in the nature
of a breach of the peace. There are two
kinds of people who ought to be gently but
firmly restrained: the person that talks too
much and the person that sings too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;This young minister undoubtedly meant
well. He&#8217;s about the kind of a chap that
I&#8217;ve seen in law-offices working for fifteen
dollars a week&ndash;&ndash;industrious, zealous, and
able up to a point, and all right under
supervision. He can be trusted to handle
a small case with intelligence and judgment.
But I wouldn&#8217;t go to him for instruction
in philosophy; and if I wished to
relay the foundation of my life I should,
naturally, consult some other person. As
one might expect, he had searched the cellars
of theology for canned goods, and with
extraordinary success.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young man had so lately arrived
in this world he couldn&#8217;t be expected to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
know much about its affairs, and especially
about those of Samuel. It was graceful
and decorous elocution. The Deacon expressed
his opinion of it in snores, and I
longed to follow suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sermon ended with a dramatic
recitation, and on our way out the minister
met us at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You must manage to keep these people
awake,&#8217; I suggested to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How am I to do it?&#8217; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, you might have a corps of pin-stickers
carefully distributed in the pews,
or you could put the pins in your sermon.
I recommend the latter.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;We went away with a sense of injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let&#8217;s keep trying,&#8217; said Betsey, &#8216;until
you find some one you would care to hear.
I would feel at home in any of our churches.
These days there&#8217;s no essential difference between
Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists,
Presbyterians, and Episcopalians.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
I&#8217;ve talked with all of them, and their differences
are dead and gone. They stand
in the printed creeds, but are no longer in
the hearts of the people.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then why all these empty churches?&#8217;
I asked. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t the people get together
in one great church?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t talk about the millennium,&#8217;
said Betsey. &#8216;We must try to make the
best of what we have.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in the next four Sundays we went
from church to church to get strength for
our souls, and found only weakness and disappointment.
Immune from ridicule and
satire, the sacred inefficiency of our pulpit
had waxed and grown and taken possession
of the churches. And one thought came to
me as I listened. There should be a number
of exits to every Christian church,
plainly marked: &#8216;To be used in case of fire.&#8217;
Ancient history, dead philosophy, sophomoric
periods, bad music, empty pews, weary
groups of the faithful longing for home,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
were, in brief, the things that we saw and
heard. It was pathetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began to think about it. Here were
five church organizations, all weak, infirm,
begging, struggling for life. The automobile
and the golf and yacht clubs had
nearly finished the work of destruction
which incompetence had so ably begun.
There was not much left of them; yet their
combined property was worth about one
hundred thousand dollars. They spent in
the aggregate fifty-six hundred dollars for
ministers&#8217; salaries, and their total average
attendance was only four hundred and forty-nine.
I could see no more extravagant
waste of time, work, and capital in any
other branch of human effort. Some would
call it wicked, but, though we speak with the
tongues of men and of angels, and have not
charity, we had better have kept still.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Reverend Mr. Knowles came to
me within a day or two and apologized
for his sermon. He complained that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
couldn&#8217;t be himself&ndash;&ndash;that he didn&#8217;t dare
speak his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Whose thoughts do you speak?&#8217; I
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, I trail along in the wake of the
fathers.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then you are feeding your flock on
corned and kippered thoughts&ndash;&ndash;on the dried
and dug-up convictions of the dead. It isn&#8217;t
fair. It isn&#8217;t even honest. The church
here is dying of anemia for want of fresh
food. The new world must have new
thought to fit new conditions. Its outlook
has been utterly changed. If a man who
had never seen a locomotive or a motor-car
or a tandem or a telephone or an
electric light or the sons and daughters of a
new millionaire or the home and crest of
the same or a bill of a modern merchant
were to come down out of the backwoods
and try to tell us how to run the world, we
should think him an ass, and wisely. Consider
how these things have changed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
spirit of man and surrounded it with new
perils.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But think of the old fellows&ndash;&ndash;the mossbacks&ndash;&ndash;who
hate your new philosophy,&#8217;
said the minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And think of the young fellows who are
so easily tossed about. The moss of senility
is covering the bloom of youth and the
honor of youth.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<h3>IN WHICH HARRY RETURNS TO POINTVIEW AND GOES TO WORK</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Betsey and I were giving a dinner-party
at our house. Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Delance and the Warburtons and
Dan and Lizzie had come over to discuss
a plan for the correction of the greatest
folly and extravagance in the village&ndash;&ndash;namely,
the waste of its spiritual energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first we had to discuss a fact related
to another folly, for the Delances told how
Harry&#8217;s pet collie had come up to the back
door that day with a human skull in his
mouth. Of course I knew that Harry&#8217;s
Bishop had returned, but held my peace
about it. To them it had suggested murder,
and they had consulted the chief of police.</p>

&#8220;HARRY&#8217;S PET COLLIE HAD COME UP TO THE BACK DOOR WITH A HUMAN SKULL IN HIS MOUTH&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How do you know that it is not one of
your ancestors dug up in a back pasture,&#8217;
I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It might be William the Conqueror,&#8217;
Lizzie remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I deny it,&#8217; said Delance, in perfect
good nature. &#8216;We have resigned from
William&#8217;s family. As a matter of fact, I
never joined it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulated him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It has always seemed like the merest
poppycock to me&ndash;&ndash;this genealogical craze
of the ladies,&#8217; said Henry. &#8216;When our
London solicitor wrote that it would take
another hundred pounds to establish the
connection beyond a doubt, he gave away
the whole scheme, and I resigned. It was
too silly. In these days of titled chambermaids
I think we shall worry along pretty
well without William.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Betsey said: &#8216;I was reading in
the county history to-day that old Zebulon
Delance, who was killed in a fight with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Indians in 1750, was buried in a meadow
back of his house.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It may be the skull of old Zeb,&#8217; said Henry.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now there&#8217;s an ancestor worth having,&#8217;
I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I wonder if it can belong to old Zeb,&#8217;
Henry mused.</p>
<p>&#8220;At last we got to my plan. I pictured
the condition of the community as I saw
it, and the inefficiency of the church and the
need of a new and active power in Pointview.</p>
<p>&#8220;I proposed that we buy the old skating-rink
and remodel it, employ the best talent
in America, and start a new center of power
in the community&ndash;&ndash;a power that should,
first of all, keep us sane, and then as decent
as possible. The mathematics of the enterprise
were at my fingers&#8217; ends:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&#8220;Initial Expenses              $15,000<br />
&#8220;Annual Outlay for Instruction   8,000<br />
&#8220;For Music                       3,500<br />
&#8220;For Maintenance                 1,000<br />
&#8220;For Management                  3,500</p>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was no small matter, but the initial expense
and the first year&#8217;s outlay were subscribed
in ten minutes. Betsey set the ball rolling
with an offer of ten thousand dollars, and
then it was like shaking ripe apples off a tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who is to be the manager?&#8217; Delance
wanted to know. &#8216;It&#8217;s a big job.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I propose that we try Harry,&#8217; I said;
&#8216;in my opinion it will interest him. I&#8217;ve
had him in training for a year or so, and
he&#8217;s about ready for big work.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t believe Harry can do it,&#8217; his
father declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I should think it might not be to his
taste,&#8217; said Bill Warburton.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I have later and better information
than the rest of you,&#8217; I said. &#8216;If you
will leave the matter in my hands you may
hold me responsible for the results.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;They gave me the white card. I could
do as I liked. The fact is, I had just had a
letter from Harry which filled me with new
hope. I have it here.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>The Honorable Socrates Potter took
the letter from his pocket and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Harry has been discovering
America. He is the Columbus of our
heiristocracy. His mental map has been
filled with great cities and splendid hotels,
and thrifty towns and enormous areas of
wheat and corn, and astonishing distances
and sublime mountain scenes. Moreover,
he has learned the joys of a simple life; he
had to. Of course, he knew of these things,
but feebly and without pride, as one knows
the Tetons who has never seen them.
Leaving in May, he stopped in all the big
cities, and finished his journey from the
railroad with a stage-ride of some ninety
miles. Of the stage-ride and other matters,
he writes thus:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;On the front seat with the driver sat
a lady smoking a cigar, who, now and then,
offered us a drink from a bottle. At her
side was a lady with a wooden leg, and a hen
in her hand. You know every woman is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
lady out here. The driver swore at the
horses, the hen swore at the lady, and
several of the passengers swore at each
other, and it was all done in the most
amiable spirit. Two rough-necks sat beside
me who kept shooting with revolvers
at sage-hens as they&ndash;&ndash;the men, not the hens&ndash;&ndash;irrigated
the tires with tobacco-juice.
At the next stop I got into a row with a
one-eyed professor of elocution, because he
said I carried too much for the size of my
mule, an&#8217; didn&#8217;t speak proper. He objected
to my pronunciation, and I to his choice
of words. In the argument his revolver
took sides with him. I got one of my toes
lopped with a bullet, and the lady who
carried the cigar and the bottle took me
to her home and nursed me like a mother,
and the lady with the wooden leg brought
me strawberries every day and sang to me
and told me some good stories. I had
thought it was a God-forsaken country, but,
you see, I was wrong. There&#8217;s more real
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
practical Christianity among these people
than I ever saw before, and it&#8217;s hard work
to be an ass here. The way of the ass is
full of trouble, and I begin to understand
why you wanted me to come out to Wyoming.
The people are rough, but as kind
as angels. Felt like turning back, but these
women put new heart in me, especially the
wooden-legged one.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;We don&#8217;t like parlor talk out here,&#8221;
she said; &#8220;it ain&#8217;t considered good ettikit.
Folks don&#8217;t mind a little, but if it goes too
fur it&#8217;s considered insultin&#8217; an&#8217; everybody
begins to speak to ye like he was talkin&#8217;
to a balky mule.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I went on as soon as I was able, and
spent the whole summer on the back of a
cayuse. Got lost in the mountains; went
hungry and cold like the wolf, as Garland
puts it, for three days; had to think my way
back to camp. It was the best schooling
in geography and logic and American
humanity that I ever had. Every man at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
the ranch, and the women, had been out
hunting for me. I offered them money,
but they woudn&#8217;t take a cent&ndash;&ndash;the joy
of seeing me was enough. They haven&#8217;t
a smitch of the revolting money-hunger
of the average European. With all its
faults I am proud of my country. I want
you to find a good, big American job for
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have been reading the Bishop of
St. Clare, who says: &#8220;There hath been more
energy expended in swaggering about with
full bellies and a burden of needless fat than
would move the island to the main shore.
If thy purse be used to buy immunity from
work, it secureth immunity from manhood;
and what is a man without manhood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There is the American idea for you.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Deacon Joe has got to change his mind
about me. Marie has only written me
one letter, and that was a frost. If you
have any influence with the girl, don&#8217;t let
her get engaged to that parson.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>Socrates laughed as he put the letter
away, and went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Harry came back, browned and
brawny, with his cayuse, saddle, and
sombrero, and a shooting-iron half as long
as my arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;He came here for a talk with me the
day after his arrival. The subject of a lifework
was pressing on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have you seen Zeb?&#8217; was his first
query.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Zeb?&#8217; I asked. &#8216;Who is Zeb?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That dear old, irrepressible bishop,&#8217;
said Harry. &#8216;They have dug him up and
named him Zeb, and put him on a top shelf
in the library. They think he is one of our
great-grandfathers.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, he has been promoted,&#8217; I remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My dog is responsible for the reappearance
of the bishop. I took him with
me that night, and he knew where to find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
it. Father is sure that it&#8217;s the head of
old Zeb Delance.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let the Bishop rest where he is,&#8217; I
suggested. &#8216;Now that he has converted
you, he will probably let up. At least, let
us hope that he will not worry you. Of
course he will remind you of past follies
every time you look at him, but that will
do you no harm.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t forget him! Father
has been reading up on Zeb, and he does
nothing but talk about him. He has learned
that the Indians buried the head and burned
the body of a victim.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He symbolizes the change in your taste.
Zeb was a man of action&ndash;&ndash;a worker. What
do you propose to do now?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, I have thought some of following
Dan into agriculture.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t,&#8217; was my answer. &#8216;You&#8217;re not
the type for that kind of a job. Dan was
brought up to work with his hands. I fear
that you would be a Fifth Avenue farmer.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, what would you say to a plant
for the manufacture of aeroplanes? I
stopped at Dayton and looked into the
matter, and learned to fly. I have ordered
a biplane, and it will be delivered in the
spring.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I vetoed that plan, and asked where he
proposed to settle.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Right here&ndash;&ndash;if possible,&#8217; said Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good! There&#8217;s one thing about your
family tree that I like, and you ought to be
proud of it. Your forebears, having been
treated with shameless oppression, came to
these inhospitable shores in 1630. They
needn&#8217;t have done it if they had been willing
to knuckle down and say they liked crow
when they didn&#8217;t. They wouldn&#8217;t do that,
so they left the old sod and ventured forth
in a little sailing-vessel on the mighty deep.
It required some courage to do that. They
landed safely, and for nearly three hundred
years their descendants have lived and
worked and suffered all manner of hardships
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
in New England. It&#8217;s a proper thing,
Harry, that you should do your work
where, mostly, they did their work&ndash;&ndash;in
dear old Connecticut.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And besides, it&#8217;s the home of Marie,&#8217;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And let us consider what there is to be
done in the home of Marie,&#8217; I went on.
&#8216;Here in the very town where so many of
your fathers have lived and worked we
find a singular parade of folly. The idle
rich from a near city are closing in upon us.
Many of the Yankees have acquired property
and ceased to work. Back in the
distant hills they toil not, but live from
hand to mouth in a pitiful state of degeneration.
The work of the hand is almost entirely
that of Italians, Poles, Hungarians,
and Greeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Our tradesmen have a low code of
honor. They overcharge us for the necessities
of life. Many of them have been
caught cheating. Our wives and sons and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
daughters are living beyond their means, as
if ignorant of the fact that it is the beginning
of dishonesty. Our poverty is
mostly that of the soul. The churches are
dying, and the sabbath is dead. What we
need is a return to the honor, sanity, and
common sense of old New England, which
gave of its fullness to the land we love.
Let&#8217;s start a school of old-fashioned decency
and Americanism. Let&#8217;s call it the Church
of All Faiths and make it a center of power.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I laid the scheme before him in all its
details, and then&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;m with you,&#8217; he said, &#8216;and I think I
can see Knowles moving and Deacon Joe
coming down off his high horse.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Possibly we could use Knowles,&#8217; I suggested.
&#8216;There&#8217;ll be a lot of detail.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But only as a kind of clerk,&#8217; said Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a kind of clerk, I agreed. &#8216;We shall
need a number of clerks. I intend that
every family within ten miles shall be
visited at least once a week. We shall not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
only let our light shine, but we shall make it
shine into every human heart in this community.
If they&#8217;re too callous we&#8217;ll punch
a hole with our trusty blade and let the
light in. The lantern and the rapier shall
be our weapons.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry was full of enthusiasm. He had
met Marie on the street, and she was glad
to learn that he was going to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Incidentally, I hope to win your grandfather&#8217;s
consent,&#8217; he had said to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she had answered: &#8216;If you could
do that I should think you were an extremely
able young man.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And worthy of the best girl living?&#8217;
Harry had urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s too extravagant,&#8217; Marie had
said as she left him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harry went to work with me at once.
He bought the rink and the ground beneath
it and some more alongside. We spent
days and nights with an architect making
and remaking the plans, and by and by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
we knew that we were right. Soon the contractor
began his work, and in three months
we had finished the most notable meeting-house
of modern times.</p>
<p>&#8220;The walls were tinted a rich cream color,
the woodwork was painted white. There
were new carpets in the aisles, and between
them comfortable seats for nine hundred
people. The fine old pulpit from which
Jonathan Edwards had preached his first
sermon was the center of a little garden
of ferns and palms and vines and mosses,
all growing in good ground, with a small
fountain in their midst&ndash;&ndash;a symbol of purity.
A great sheet of plate glass behind the
pulpit showed a thicket of evergreens.
High above the pulpit was another big
sheet of glass, through which one got a
broad view of the sky, and it was framed
in these words: &#8216;The heavens declare the
glory of God and the firmament showeth
his handiwork.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The walls were adorned with handsome
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
pictures loaned by my friends. On one
wall were these modern commandments,
most of which were gleaned from the
masterly volume entitled <i>The Life and
Writings of Robert Delance, Bishop of St.
Clare</i>, which Harry had found in a London
bookstore:</p>
<p>&#8220;1. &#8216;Be grateful unto God, for He hath
given thee life, time, and this beautiful
world. Other things thou shalt find for
thyself.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;2. &#8216;Be brave with thy life, for it is very
long.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;3. &#8216;Waste no time, for thy time is very
little.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;4. &#8216;See that this world is the better for
thy work and kindness.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;5. &#8216;Doubt not the truth of that thy
senses tell thee, for thy God is no deceiver.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;6. &#8216;Love the truth and live it, for no one
is long deceived by lying.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;7. &#8216;Give not unto the beast and neglect
thy brother.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>&#8220;8. &#8216;Go find thy brothers in the world
and see that these be many, for a man&#8217;s
strength and happiness are multiplied by
the number of his brothers.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;9. &#8216;Beware lest thy wealth come between
thee and them and tend to thine own
poverty and theirs.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;10. &#8216;Suffer little children to come unto
thee, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The simple-hearted old Bishop had just
the philosophy we needed. It seemed to
have been carefully designed to meet the inventiveness
of the modern sinner. He was
turning out well and had already exerted a
wholesome influence on the character of
Harry. Would that all ancestors were as
well chosen!</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not wish to hinder the other
churches, and that spirit went into all our
plans. First, then, we decided that our
services should begin at twelve o&#8217;clock
every Sunday, and close at one or before
twenty minutes after one. That gave our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
parishioners a chance to go to the other
churches if they wanted to. I traveled
from Boston to St. Louis, and returned <i>via</i>
Washington, to engage talent for our pulpit.
I wanted the best that this land afforded,
and was prepared to pay its price. I engaged
nine ministers, distinguished for
eloquence and learning, three Governors,
the Mayor of a Western city, two United
States Senators, one Congressman, and a Justice
of the Supreme Court of the land. They
were all great-souled men, who had shown
in word and action a touch of the spirit
of Jesus Christ. Some of them had been
throwing light into dark places and driving
money-changers from the temple and casting
out devils. They were all qualified to
enlighten and lift up our souls.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked that their lessons should be
drawn from the lives of the modern prophets&ndash;&ndash;Abraham
Lincoln, Silas Wright, Daniel
Webster, Charles Sumner, Henry Clay,
Noah Webster, George William Curtis,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Sidney Lanier,
Horace Greeley, and others like them. What
I sought most was an increase of the love
of honor and the respect for industry in our
young men and women. Holiness was a
thing for later consideration, it seemed to
me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I put a full-page advertisement in each
local paper, which read about as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Church of All Faiths.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Built especially for sinners and for
good people who wish to be better.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Will begin its work in this community
Sunday, June 19th, at twelve o&#8217;clock, with
a sermon by Socrates Potter, Esq., of
Pointview, in which he will set forth his
view of what a church should do, and an
account of what this church proposes to do,
for its parishioners. Other churches are
cordially invited to worship, and to work
with us for the good of Pointview.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The curiosity of all the people had been
whetted to a keen edge. They had begged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
for information, but Betsey and I had said
that they should know all about it in due
time. I had given my plan to the contributors
only, and they were to keep still
about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes silence is the best advertisement,
and certain men who seem to be so
modest that they are shocked by the least
publicity are the greatest advertisers in the
world. The man who hides his candle under
a bushel is apt to be the one whose
candle is best known. So it happened
with us. Nine hundred and sixteen people
filled the seats in our church that morning by
twelve o&#8217;clock, and two hundred more were
trying to get in.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the next service an honored minister
whose soul is even greater than his fame
preached for us, and that week a petition
came to me, signed by six hundred citizens,
complaining that the hour was inconvenient,
and asking that it be changed to 10.30
<span class='smcap'>A.M.</span> I believe in the voice of the people,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
and obeyed it; but I knew what would
happen, and it did. The other churches
were deserted and silent. One by one
their ministers came to see me&ndash;&ndash;all save
one old gentleman in whom the brimstone
of wrath had begun to burn more fiercely.
We needed and were glad to have the help
of two of them. There were the sick and
the poor to be visited; there were weddings
and funerals and countless details in the
organization of the new church to be attended
to.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to tell you that a curious and
unexpected thing had happened. Fisherfolk,
street gamins, caddies, loafers on the
docks and in the livery stables, millionaires
and million-heiresses&ndash;&ndash;people who had
thought themselves either above or below
religion&ndash;&ndash;came to our meetings. Each resembled
in numbers a political rally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have started an improvement school
for Sunday evenings, in which the great
story is told in lectures and fine photographs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
thrown on a screen. And not only
the great story, but any story calculated
to inspire and enlighten the youthful mind.
The best of the world&#8217;s work and art and
certain of the great novels will be presented
in this way. I am going to get
the great men of the world to give us
three-minute sermons on the phonograph.
Thus I hope to make it possible for our
people to hear the voices and sentiments
of kings, presidents, premiers, statesmen,
and prophets&ndash;&ndash;the men and women who are
making history.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have started a small country club
where poor boys and girls can enjoy billiards,
bowling, golf, and tennis. Any boy or
girl in this town who has a longing for
better things is sought and found by our
ministers, and all kinds of encouragement
are offered. People and clergy of almost
every faith that is known here in Pointview
are working side by side for one purpose.
Think of that! The revolution has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
complete and mainly peaceful. As to the
expense of it all, we tax the rich, and for
the rest we temper the wind to the length
of their wool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, there were certain people
who didn&#8217;t like it, and among them was
Deacon Joe. He and four others hired a
minister, and sat in lonely sorrow in the
old church every Sunday, until the expense
sickened them. Then the Deacon got mad
at the town, and refused to be seen in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Reach everybody,&#8217; had been one of
our mottoes, and Deacon Joe said that he
guessed we wouldn&#8217;t reach him.&#8221;</p>

<h3>WHICH PRESENTS AN INCIDENT IN OUR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NEW NEW ENGLAND</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We had some adventures in new New
England which ought to be set down.
Here&#8217;s one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old village of Trent lies back in the
hills, a little journey from Pointview, on the
shores of a pleasant river. To the unknowing
traveler, who approaches from
either hilltop, it has a peaceful and inviting
look. But the rutted, rocky road
begins at once to excite suspicion. A bad
road is an indication and a producer of
degeneracy in man and beast. It tends to
profanity, and if it went far would probably
lead to hell. Trent itself is one of the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
modern hells of New England. There are
the venerable and neatly fashioned houses
of the old-time Yankee&ndash;&ndash;the peaked roofs
and gables, the columns, the cozy verandas,
the garden spaces. But the old-time
Yankees are gone. The well-kept gardens
are no more. Many of the houses are
going to ruin. One is an Italian tenement.
The others are inhabited by coachmen,
chauffeurs, gardeners, mill-hands, and degenerate
Yankees. The inn is a mere barroom.
Sounds of revelry and the odor of
stale beer come out of it. In front are
teams of burden, abandoned, for a time,
by their drivers, and sundry human signs
of decay loafing in the shadow of the old
lindens. Among them are the seedy remnants
of a once noble race. They are
fettered by &#8216;rheumatiz&#8217; and the disordered
liver. They move like boats dragging their
anchors. To make life tolerable their imaginations
need assistance. They are like
the Flub Dubs of lost Atlantis. Each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
imagines himself the greatest man in the
village. They talk in loud words. They
quarrel and fight over the crown. So it
has been a brawling, besotted community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trent&#8217;s leading citizen is a Yankee
politician who owns most of its real estate
and derives a profit from its lawless traffic.
Trent has been his enterprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knowles went over there one day to
conduct a funeral, which was interrupted
by a dog-fight under the coffin and nearly
broken up by a row over two dollars which
had been found in a pocket of the dead man.</p>
<p>&#8220;We opened a club-house next to the
hotel, and began a campaign for the regeneration
of Trent. Soon we discovered
that its one officer was unwilling to arrest
offenders against law and order. We had
him removed and a new man put in his
place. This man was set upon and severely
beaten, and lost interest in the good work.
Then Harry applied for the job and got it.
He took with him a force of husky young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
men&ndash;&ndash;mostly college boys. The first day
on duty he arrested in the street a drunken
man who carried in his hands a small sack
of potatoes. The latter whistled for help,
and the enemies of law and order swarmed
out of their haunts. Harry had become
an expert ball pitcher, noted for speed and
accuracy. He floored his man and took
possession of the potatoes, with which he
proceeded to defend himself. Only two
balls were pitched, but they held the enemy
in check until Harry&#8217;s deputies had rushed
out of the club-house. A flying wedge
scattered the crowd. No further violence
was needed. The ruffians saw that he
meant business and had the nerve and
muscle to carry it through, and nothing
more was necessary&ndash;&ndash;just then.</p>
<p>&#8220;They took the drunken man to the
lock-up, and came back and got a bartender,
and led him in the same path.
Harry has the situation well in hand, and is
the most popular man in our community.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Every day we have items to put to his
credit, and nothing to charge against his
reputation. There&#8217;s something going on
at the club every evening, and the rooms
are crowded. Those men who had sat day
by day brawling under the lindens now
spend most of their leisure in the reading
and card rooms. Peace reigns in Trent.
Such is the power of united benevolence
working with the strong hand and the
courageous spirit.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>WHICH PRESENTS A DECISIVE INCIDENT IN OUR CAMPAIGN AGAINST OLD NEW ENGLAND</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Harry was pretty well disabled with
affection for a time. He was like a
Yankee with the &#8216;rheumatiz,&#8217; and you
know when a Yankee gets hold of the
&#8216;rheumatiz&#8217; he hangs on. It don&#8217;t often
get away from him. It becomes an asset&ndash;&ndash;a
conservational asset&ndash;&ndash;an ever-present
help in time of haying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since Harry&#8217;s return the tactics of
Marie had been faultless. Her eyes had
said, &#8216;Come on,&#8217; while her words had firmly
held him off. He shook the tree every
time they met, but the squirrel wouldn&#8217;t
come down.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was a hard part for Marie to play,
between the pressure of two handsome boys
and her duty to grandpapa. The Reverend
Robert had won the favor of the old gentleman
by turning from tennis to agriculture
for exercise. He had gone over to the
Benson farm and helped with the spring&#8217;s
work; he had supper there every Sunday
evening, after which he conducted a little
service for the Deacon&#8217;s benefit. He was
pressing, as they say in golf, and it didn&#8217;t
improve his game. I saw that Marie
was not quite so fond of him. I had maintained
an attitude of strict neutrality, but
could not fail to observe that Marie had
begun to lean.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have captured the rest of Pointview,
and you ought to be able to take
Benson&#8217;s Hill,&#8217; Marie had said to Harry.
&#8216;Grandfather is the last enemy of your
crusade.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a timely touch on the accelerator,
and Harry began to speed up a little.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The farm is so well defended, and there&#8217;s
nothing I dread so much as a hickory cane,&#8217;
the boy had answered. &#8216;The last visit
I made to the farm I wondered whether I
was going to convert him to my way of
thinking, or he was going to convert me to
jelly.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, Deacon Joe stood firm as a
mountain. People were saying that the
minister would win in a walk, when Marie
converted her grandfather by the most
remarkable bit of woman&#8217;s strategy that I
ever observed. It was Napoleonic.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day in May, Harry came, much
excited, to my office. Deacon Joe was about
to move to his island, a mile or so off shore.
He was going to take Marie with him for
an indefinite period. No boat would be
permitted to land there except his own and
the Reverend Robert&#8217;s. Marie would be
a sort of prisoner. That day she had
told him of the plan of her grandfather.
In Harry&#8217;s opinion Knowles had suggested it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where is the girl&#8217;s mother?&#8217; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;On some Cook&#8217;s tour in Europe, and
the old man is crazy as a March hare,&#8217; said
my young friend. &#8216;He&#8217;s got a lot of bulldogs
over there, and his hired men have
been instructed to shoot a hole in any
boat that comes near.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I went over to the Benson homestead
that afternoon, and found Deacon Joe
sitting on the piazza.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How are you?&#8217; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not very stout,&#8217; said he; &#8216;heart flutters
like a ketched bird.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What are you doing for it?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Doctor give me some medicine; I
fergit the name of it, but it is the stuff they
use to blow up safes with.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nitroglycerin! The very thing! I
hope they will succeed in blowing up your safe.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was pretty close to the old man, and
was always very frank with him. He liked
opposition, and was as fond of warfare as
an Old Testament hero.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What, sir?&#8217; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There are some folks that have got to
be blowed up before you can get an old
idea out of their heads,&#8217; I went on. &#8216;They
are locked up with rust. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s
the matter with you, Deacon. Your brain
needs to be blowed open an&#8217; aired. You
stored it full of ideas sixty years ago and
locked the door for fear they&#8217;d get away.
They should have been taken out and
sorted over at least once a year, and some
thrown into the fire to make room for better
ones. If life does you any good, if it really
teaches you anything, your brain must keep
changing its contents.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Deacon hammered the table with
his cane, as he shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You cussed fool of a lawyer! Don&#8217;t
you know that truth never changes? Truth,
sir, is eternal.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I took the bat. &#8216;Truth often
changes, but error is eternal,&#8217; I said. &#8216;You
know when you want to prove anything,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
these days, you quote from the memoirs
of a great man. Well, I was reading the
memoirs of the late Doctor Godfrey Vogeldam
Guph not long ago. He told of a man
who was very singular, but not so singular as
the doctor seemed to think. This man knew
more than any human being has a right
to know. He knew the plans of God, and
had formed an unalterable opinion about
all his neighbors. Then he locked up his
mind and guarded it night and day, for fear
that somebody would break in and carry
off its contents. And it did seem as if
people wanted to get hold of his treasure,
for they often came and asked about it,
and some even questioned its value. He
said, &#8220;Away with you&ndash;&ndash;truth is eternal,
and my soul is full and I will part with none
of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Meanwhile the truth about things
around him began to change. Neighbor
Smith became a good man. Neighbor
Brown became a bad man. Priscilla
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
Jones, who had been a vain and foolish
woman, was one of the saints of God. The
foundations of the world had changed. In
a generation it had grown millions of years
older and different&ndash;&ndash;wonderfully different!
Even God himself had changed, it would
seem. His methods were not as people
had thought them. His character was
milder. Everything had changed but this
one man. Now when he died and came to
St. Peter, the latter said to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Who were your friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The new-comer thought a minute,
and mentioned the names of some people who
had been long dead. &#8220;They know the truth
about me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Ah, but the truth changes, and they
haven&#8217;t seen you in many years,&#8221; said St.
Peter.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;But I have not changed,&#8221; said the
man. &#8220;I am just as when they saw me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Then you are a fool or the chief of
sinners,&#8221; said St. Peter. &#8220;Behold a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
as changeless as the flint-stone, who has
made no friends in over forty years! That
is all I need to know about you. Take
either gate you please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;One leads to Heaven&ndash;&ndash;doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said the new-comer, in great alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8220;Yes, but you wouldn&#8217;t recognize the
place. There isn&#8217;t a soul in paradise that
cares which way you go&ndash;&ndash;not a soul in all
its multitude that will be glad to see you.
They have better company. Stranger! go
which way you please, Heaven will be as
uncomfortable as hell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deacon Joe gave me close attention,
and I saw that my sword had nicked him a
little. Anything that affected his hope of
Paradise was sure to engage his thought.
He shook his head, and said that he didn&#8217;t
believe it. But he couldn&#8217;t fool me. I
knew that the seed of change had struck
into him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave him another thrust. &#8216;Deacon,
you knew Harry Delance when he was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
fool. But the truth about <i>him</i> has changed.
He is now a hard-working, level-headed
young fellow, and you ought to be his
friend.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wal, I like the way he cuffed them
fellers over at Trent,&#8217; said the Deacon.
&#8216;He pounded &#8217;em noble&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s sartin.
Mebbe if he licks a few more men I&#8217;ll begin
to like him.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Give him a chance,&#8217; was my answer.
&#8216;I hear that you are going to move for the
summer.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Goin&#8217; to my island to-morrow,&#8217; said
Deacon Joe. &#8216;I&#8217;m sick of the autymobiles
an&#8217; the young spendthrifts hangin&#8217; around
Marie, an&#8217; her extravagance, an&#8217; the new
church nonsense, an&#8217; the other goin&#8217;s-on.
I&#8217;ve got a good house there, an&#8217; Marie an&#8217;
I are goin&#8217; to rest an&#8217; stroll around without
bein&#8217; run over until her mother comes back.
The only trouble I have there is the hired
men. They rob me right an&#8217; left. I wish
somebody would lick them.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You really need a young man like
Harry,&#8217; I urged. &#8216;And Marie needs him.
She&#8217;ll be lonely over there.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not a bit,&#8217; said the Deacon. &#8216;She&#8217;ll
have a saddle-horse, and young Knowles
can come over once a week, if he wants to.
I hear he&#8217;s done splendid lately.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He&#8217;s doing well, but I am inclined to
think that Harry is the better man,&#8217; I said,
taking sides for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t believe it,&#8217; was the answer of
Deacon Joe. &#8216;Knowles is getting pretty
sensible, and his voice is stronger.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Deacon moved next day, and when
Sunday came I went over in a boat with
the Reverend Robert at eight o&#8217;clock in
the morning. I was taking a stroll on the
beach when I met him, and he asked me to
go along. It was just a social call, he explained.
Incidentally, he was going to
pray and read a Scripture lesson at the
Deacon&#8217;s request. As we left the dock,
Harry came riding by on one of his thoroughbreds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
and I waved my hand to him. When
we got to the Deacon&#8217;s landing, I said to
Robert:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;As I am not invited, perhaps you had
better announce me to Deacon Joe, while
I stay here in the boat.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All right,&#8217; he said, as he gaily jumped
ashore and tied the painter rope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert hurried in the direction of the
little house, and had covered half the
distance, when a bulldog came sneaking
toward him. Robert saw the dog, and ran
for a tree. He was making handsome progress
up the trunk of the tree when the dog
reached him, and, seizing a leg of his trousers,
began to surge backward. The cloth parted
at the knee, and between the pulling of
man and dog, Robert lost about all the
lower end of one trousers-leg. The hired
man came running out with some more
dogs, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s all right, Mr. Knowles, you can
come down. I hope he didn&#8217;t hurt you.&#8217;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Excuse me,&#8217; said the young man, &#8216;but
I think I&#8217;ll stay here a while.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three dogs stood at the foot of the
tree looking anxiously upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;They won&#8217;t hurt you while I&#8217;m here,&#8217;
said the hired man.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I won&#8217;t take any chances,&#8217; said Robert.
&#8216;Go shut up your lions, and I&#8217;ll come down.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who&#8217;s that in the boat?&#8217; the hired man
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mr. Potter,&#8217; said Robert.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, he mustn&#8217;t land &#8217;less the old man
says so&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t care who he is.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just then the hired man changed his
position suddenly, and stood looking into
the sky. I turned and saw an aeroplane
coming down like some great bird from the
hills, behind the village. It sailed high
above the spires, and coasted down to a
level some fifty feet above the water-plane
between shore and island. In a minute
or so it roared over me, circled the point,
and came down in the open field that faced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
the Deacon&#8217;s cottage. Dogs and chickens
flew and ran in great confusion as it swooped
to earth. I knew that Harry and his new
flier had reached the island of Deacon Joe,
and I hurried ashore to see&ndash;&ndash;well, &#8216;to see
what I could see,&#8217; as the old song has it.
Harry jumped from his seat. The hired man
ran toward him. Deacon Joe and Marie
and a woman-servant hurried out-of-doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;In less time than it takes to tell it,
Harry had licked the hired man, and kicked
two dogs in the belly till they ran for life,
and shot another one, and was chasing a
second hired man around the wood-shed.
Not being able to run fast enough to do further
damage, Harry came to the astonished
group in front of the house and caught
Marie in his arms and kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he turned to the Deacon, and said:
&#8216;Sir, I will keep off your island if you wish,
but I do not propose to be bluffed when I
come to pay my compliments to you and
Marie.&#8217;</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Deacon Joe was dumb with astonishment.
The young minister came down
out of his tree and walked slowly toward
the group, with rags flapping over one extremity
of his union-suit. He looked like
a man with a wooden leg.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How did ye get here?&#8217; Deacon Joe
demanded of Harry.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Jumped from the top of Delance&#8217;s Hill
and landed right here,&#8217; said the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;In that awful-lookin&#8217; thing?&#8217; the
Deacon asked, pointing with his cane and
squinting at the big biplane.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;In that thing,&#8217; Harry answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How long did it take ye?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;About five minutes.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s impossible,&#8217; said the Deacon, as
he approached the biplane and began to
look at it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But you&#8217;ll see me jump back again
in a little while,&#8217; Harry assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Geehanniker!&#8217; the Deacon exclaimed.
&#8216;Jumped from the top of Delance&#8217;s Hill an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
licked my caretaker an&#8217; chased a hired man
an&#8217; sp&#8217;ilt two dogs an&#8217; treed the minister
and kissed the lady o&#8217; the house&ndash;&ndash;all in
about ten minutes. I guess you&#8217;re a good
deal of a feller.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the kind of thing that warmed
the warrior soul of the Deacon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hello&ndash;&ndash;here&#8217;s a dead dog,&#8217; said Harry.
&#8216;If you&#8217;ll have one of the men bring me a
shovel I&#8217;ll bury him there in the garden.
Meanwhile you may tell me how much
I owe you for the two dogs.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I guess about twenty-five dollars,&#8217;
said the Deacon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;How much off for cash?&#8217; Harry asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wal, sir, if you ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to ask me
to charge it, ten dollars would do,&#8217; the
Deacon allowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s a wonderful power in cash,&#8217;
said Harry, as he produced the money.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re gettin&#8217; some sense in your
head,&#8217; said the Deacon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The shovel was brought; and Harry,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
who had expected to shoot a dog or two
and had been practising for this very act,
put his victim under three feet of soil in
as many minutes. That also pleased the
Deacon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Purty cordy, too,&#8217; the latter said, as
he turned to Marie. &#8216;Now, girl, take your
choice. I want to know which is which,
an&#8217; stop bein&#8217; bothered about it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She made her choice then and there,
and as to which of the two it may have been
you will have no doubt when I tell you that
Marie had planned every detail in this bit
of strategy and Harry had been man
enough to put it through.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You know Zeb&#8217;s commandment has
been a help to me,&#8217; he said, when I offered
congratulations. &#8216;&#8220;Be brave with your life,
for it is very long.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Deacon has changed. His heart
and mind are open. Every Sunday you
may see him in a front seat, drinking at the
new fount of inspiration; and it is a rule of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
his life to make a new friend every day.
I&#8217;m inclined to think that the old man has
been saved at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we try to reach everybody in one
way or another.&#8221;</p>
<p style='text-align:center;margin-top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em'>THE END</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
